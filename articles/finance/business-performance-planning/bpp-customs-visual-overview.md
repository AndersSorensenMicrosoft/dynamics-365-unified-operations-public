# Business performance planning custom visuals overview 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Dynamics 365 Finance Business performance planning offers a specialized toolkit of seven custom Power BI visuals tailored to your financial planning needs. These custom visuals provide a comprehensive range of tools that add planning and financial reporting functions to Power BI, streamlining the traditionally labor-intensive processes and enable swift insights and informed decision-making. With intuitive controls and powerful functionalities, custom visuals transform financial planning by promoting accuracy, efficiency, and agility, allowing you to focus on strategic analysis rather than data manipulation. 
Each of the planning application visuals are designed to work together cohesively creating a “flow of work” that empowers you to enforce controls and approval processes thereby standardizing your planning processes across the enterprise. 

All the planning and forecasting performed on the visuals below can be effortlessly written back to the planning apps data repository (Dataverse), ensuring a seamless integration of your planning data between Power BI and the application.   

## Matrix planning 

The Matrix planning visual is the default in the planning application's suite of visuals. Use the Matrix planning to design comprehensive planning scenarios. After they're published, the interactive planning reports and dashboards enable exciting and powerful capabilities for Power BI users across your organization.  

### Key features

- Enter data for planning or forecasting scenarios in a user-friendly tabular format directly within the Power BI report page.
- Update data in the Business performance planning tables (Dataverse) with the “write-back” feature when changes are made in Power BI.
- Plan, at any level, with drill-down capability into rows and columns along with top-down allocation capabilities.  

## Graphical planning 

Graphical planning offers a dynamic approach to planning, allowing you to interact with graphs and charts to fine-tune underlying values. Like the Matrix planning visual, you can create comprehensive plans with visual manipulation capabilities. 

### Key features

- Accomplish planning and write-back to Business performance planning Dataverse tables by dragging bar or line chart elements.
- Plan at any level of detail with drill-down and top-down allocation capabilities.
- Enter data as an absolute value or as a percentage of the total, enabling flexibility in your planning approach. 

## Reporting 

The Reporting visual is your go-to solution to generate polished financial reports within Power BI. This visual offers advanced row and column formatting, empowering you to create comprehensive financial statements such as cash flow, income statements, balance sheets, and more with ease.  

### Key features

- Easily add subtotal and custom calculations anywhere in the report.
- Format data on the reports with enhanced capabilities resulting in professional and polished presentation.
- Include a view of variances within your reports, providing valuable insights into your financial data.  

## Table edit 

You can use the Table edit visual to directly edit dimensional tables within Power BI, enhancing the efficiency of business performance planning. This feature is designed to facilitate master data management and streamline workflows, making financial planning more agile and effective. 

### Key features 

- Easily create budget planning or forecasting scenarios and versions, facilitating an agile planning process.
- Effortlessly create, update, or delete data in dimensional tables with bulk editing capabilities, saving time and reducing effort.
- Seamlessly adapt to your organizational workflows such as designing and implementing standardized approval workflows. 

## Variance 

The Variance visual empowers you to enhance your variance analysis by offering customizable key performance indicator (KPI) cards and flexible visualization options. You can easily visualize variances through vertical or horizontal bar charts, and toggle between absolute, relative, and waterfall variance displays. Additionally, this visual allows for in-depth category drill-down and offers custom tooltips for comprehensive insights. 

### Key features 

- Visualize discrepancies between budget and actuals, providing a clear view of where discrepancies exist for informed decision-making.
- Dive deeper into your analysis with transaction-level details stored in a dedicated Power BI table, enabling comprehensive investigation.
- Sorted bar charts swiftly reveal key drivers behind variances, aiding in root cause analysis for future planning cycles. 

## Copy 

Effortlessly copy baseline data for new planning scenarios. 

Use the Copy visual to effortlessly transfer baseline data, including actuals or forecasts, into new planning or forecasting scenarios. You have the flexibility to select the level of detail during copying, allowing for precise scenario creation. For instance, easily copy data from previous year's actuals as the foundation for a new plan, whether it's a complete copy or with specific dimensional filters, such as copying data for a particular department or product. 

### Key features 

- Define specific dimension coordinates to copy and paste values from a source to a target, ensuring consistency and accuracy in scenario creation.
- Create forecasts and budgets by building upon historical actuals, reducing redundancy, and promoting accuracy.
- Develop multiple forecast scenarios efficiently by building a base case and copying permutations as needed for comprehensive analysis. 

## Comments 

Use the Comments visual to collect comments directly from a Power BI report or comments entered in the Matrix visual. The Comments visual serves as your all-in-one solution to gather comments and facilitate collaborative feedback during the planning process. 

### Key features

- Capture and store comments directly within your planning process, ensuring all feedback is centralized and easily accessible.
- Assist reviewers and approvers with faster decision making.
- Visual supports rich text formatting with hyperlink embedding.
