> Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) will be deprecated. All new RCS provisioning is stopped as of 10.0.39 GA. If provisioning is required, please register a support ticket. We will be providing tools and required support for migration from RCS to the **Globalization Studio** workspace. We plan to fully shut down RCS by August 1, 2024.
