[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides information that will help you get started with Electronic invoicing for France. It guides you through the configuration steps that are country-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) and in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. These steps complement the steps that are described in [Get started with the Electronic invoicing add-on](e-invoicing-get-started.md).

## Country-specific configuration for French Chorus Pro submission (FR) Electronic invoicing feature

Some steps are required to configure the **French Chorus Pro submission (FR)** Electronic invoicing feature. Some of the parameters from the configuration are published with default values. These values must be reviewed and updated so that they better reflect your business operations.
