# Deferrals for project transactions

Subscription billing enables organizations to manage revenue and expense deferrals through deferral schedules. Projects help you plan, create, manage, control, and complete customer-focused work for your organization. On some time-and-material projects, the revenue or cost may need to be deferred and recognized over a period of time.

For example, for one project, the customer agrees to pay for a yearly subscription for a service, such as cloud storage or a support contract. A deferral schedule can be created allowing the revenue for this project to be recognized monthly for the service. This approach helps manage revenue for the project as it can be recognized at the time it is earned.

> [!NOTE]
> Billing schedules with projects are available only in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations â€“ Stocked/Production-based deployments. 

## Enable billing schedules with projects

In the **Feature management** workspace, you must enable the **Billing schedules and deferrals with projects** feature in the **Subscription billing** module. After it's enabled, refresh the browser window. This integration works with the **Project management and accounting** module in Dynamics 365 Finance.

## Project group setup

A project group option for **Deferred** has been added to the **Post costs** options for **Post costs - hour**, **Post costs - expense**, and **Post costs - item** fields. In addition, fields for **Deferred revenue - hour**, **Deferred revenue - expense**, **Deferred revenue - item** and **Deferred revenue - fee** are added to the project group.

> [!NOTE]
> The deferred option for post costs and the deferred revenue options are available for time and material projects only.

## Creating project transactions with deferrals

To create a deferral schedule from a time and material project, follow these steps:

1. On the **All projects** page, select a project.
2. Select the **Project contract**. 
3. Select **Add**, to create a Billing rule with **Line type** of **Time and material**.
4. Move the **ProjectID** to the **Selected projects** list.
5. Select **Chargeable categories**. Move the desired categories for deferrals to the **Selected categories** list. 
6. Enter project hour, expense, fee or sales order transactions.

> [!NOTE]
> A deferred option will display and will be marked on the line for transactions that are configured correctly for deferrals.

7. Create and post the **Invoice proposal**. Deferral schedules will be created when the invoice proposal is posted.

The **All deferral schedules** page shows the newly created deferral schedule. By default, the **Transaction type** will reflect the originating project transaction type for the deferral.

## Viewing a deferral schedule from a project or a project contract

To view a deferral for a project transaction:

1. On the project or project contract, select **Posted transactions**.
2. Select the project transaction.
3. Select **Subscription billing** and then **Deferral schedules**.
