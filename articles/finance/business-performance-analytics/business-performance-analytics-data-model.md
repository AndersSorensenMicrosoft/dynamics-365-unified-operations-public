# Business performance analytics data model

A business matrix is a roadmap for business data. Business data can be defined by value chains such as *record to report* or *order to cash*. The business matrix organizes, connects, and simplifies data. In this way, it helps users efficiently navigate and understand their data.

## Record to report

*Record to report* covers the process from data collection through the final financial report. It ensures that business events are accurately recorded, processed, and summarized into financial statements and management reports.

## Procure to pay

*Procure to pay* covers the complete cycle from the procurement of goods and services through the payment of vendors. It's crucial for managing costs, ensuring timely payments, and maintaining good vendor relationships.
