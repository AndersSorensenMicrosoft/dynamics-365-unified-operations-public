# Warehouse Mobile app accessibility features

The Warehouse Management mobile app is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that workers with all types of abilities can interact with the app effectively. This article describes the many accessibility features of the Warehouse Management mobile app.

## Font and button scaling

Font and button scaling ensure the app remains worker-friendly and accessible to many workers, including those with visual impairments.

- **Font Scaling** – The app supports font scaling from 50% to 400%, allowing workers to adjust the text size to their preference. This flexibility ensures that workers can comfortably read and interact with the app's content, regardless of their visual acuity. The font size in the app is independent of the operating system's font settings, so workers can set font sizes in the app separately from their device, allowing for a more personalized experience.
- **Button Scaling** – The app supports button scaling from 50% to 200%. This feature enables workers to adjust the size of buttons and other interactive elements within the app, making it easier to tap and interact with its functionality.

## Multiple color themes

The app is designed to cater to diverse workers, including those with visual impairments or specific color preferences. To achieve this, it offers four different themes that workers can choose from, ensuring a comfortable and accessible experience for everyone. The Warehouse Management mobile app supports the following themes:

- **Auto** – Matches the operation system settings for your device.
- **Light** – Features a light background with dark text, providing a clean and easy-to-read interface for workers who prefer a bright appearance.
- **Dark** – Offers a dark background with light text, reducing eye strain for workers who prefer a more subdued color scheme, especially in low-light environments.
- **High-contrast white** – This high-contrast theme features a white background with bold, black text and high-contrast colors for interactive elements. It is designed to enhance readability for workers with visual impairments or those who require a higher level of contrast to read a text and interact with the app comfortably.
- **High-contrast black** – This high-contrast theme features a black background, white text, and high-contrast colors for interactive elements. This theme is also designed to improve readability and accessibility for workers with visual impairments or those who require a higher level of contrast.

## Choice of button positions

The Warehouse Management mobile app offers customizable button positions, allowing workers to tailor the app's interface to their needs and preferences. The app supports the following button positions:

- **Top-left** – Places buttons in the top-left corner of the screen, providing easy access for workers who prefer to interact with the app using their left hand or who find this position more comfortable.
- **Top-right** – With buttons positioned in the top-right corner of the screen, this option caters to workers who prefer to interact with the app using their right hand or who find this position more convenient.
- **Bottom-left** – Places buttons in the bottom-left corner of the screen, offering easy access for workers who prefer a lower part for their interactive elements, mainly when using their left hand.
- **Bottom-right** – Places buttons in the bottom-right corner of the screen, catering to workers who prefer a lower part for their interactive elements and who find this position more comfortable when using their right hand.

## Screen reader support

The app is accessible on three major platforms: Android, iOS, and Windows. To provide a seamless experience for workers with visual impairments, it supports (and is limited to) the following screen readers on each platform:

- **Android TalkBack** – TalkBack is a preinstalled screen reader on Android devices that provides spoken feedback to help workers navigate and interact with their devices.
- **Windows Narrator** – Narrator is an integrated screen reader for Windows devices that reads aloud text on the screen.
- **iOS VoiceOver** – VoiceOver is a built-in screen reader on iOS devices that offers spoken feedback.

By supporting these screen readers, the Warehouse Management mobile app ensures that workers with visual impairments can access and interact with the app effectively, regardless of their platform.
