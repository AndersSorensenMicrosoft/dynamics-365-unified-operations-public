> [!NOTE]
> Use of the [One voucher](../general-ledger/one-voucher.md) functionality introduces a limitation on further Fiscal journal reporting for some scenarios that are subject to this report. Specifically, a bank statement scenario must be posted by using different vouchers for transactions that have different counteragent accounts. We recommend that you set the **Allow multiple transactions within one voucher** parameter on the **General ledger parameters** page to **No** in your legal entity if you post transactions that are part of the Fiscal journal report. For information about One voucher functionality, see [One voucher](../general-ledger/one-voucher.md).


## Fiscal journal page numbering improvements

You can enable the feature **(Italy) Fiscal journal page numbering improvements** in the **Feature management** workspace.

This feature improves the calculation logic for page numbering in the Italian fiscal journal report. To update and store the page numbers, print the report to a screen with the **Report PDF Viewer** feature enabled, or print the report to a file in PDF format. Page numbers are calculated using the new algorithm when the fiscal journal report is printed in PDF format. Page numbers are stored so that pages for the next monthâ€™s report start sequentially using the next number after the stored one. This feature also enables an algorithm for grouping lines with the same column values into one line, so that only the necessary pages are included in the report printout.

If you need to calculate the number of the documents included in the Fiscal journal, complete the following steps.

1.	Print the report in a PDF file format.
2.	Convert the PDF to Microsoft Excel using a converter software.
3.	Create a pivot table and in the **Rows** field, select **Docum. No.**.

    ![Excel pivot table.](media/ExcelPivotTable.png)

The number of documents is equal to number of lines in the pivot table.
