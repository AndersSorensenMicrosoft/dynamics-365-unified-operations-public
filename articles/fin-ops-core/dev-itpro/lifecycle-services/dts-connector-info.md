The Dynamics 365 Translation Service connector integrates with the Power Platform which allows you to access DTS directly from a flow or app. This connector calls the DTS API on your behalf, saving you a trip to the website.

The following functionality is supported:
- Translate user interface (UI) files
- Regenerate translation requests
- Creating translation memory (TM) files

Documentation is available [here]( https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/dynamicstranslations).
