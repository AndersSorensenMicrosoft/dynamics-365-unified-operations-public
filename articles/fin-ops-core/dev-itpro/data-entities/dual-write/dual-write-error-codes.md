# Error codes for Dual-write and Data Integrator

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the error codes that can occur when configuring either Dual-write maps or data integration projects with Data Integrator.

| Error code | Message | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DIPV1000 | Connection validation failed | <p>The error indicates that the Power Apps ApiHub connections used for data integration with Data Integrator are no longer valid.</p><p>The error message details show the actual cause of the validation failure. You should fix the connections as indicated or recreate the connection sets to ensure data integration continues to work. For more information on creating connection sets with Data Integrator, see [How to create a connection set](/power-platform/admin/data-integrator#how-to-create-a-connection-set).</p> | 
| DIPV1001 | Exceptions encountered during Dual-write project validation | The error indicates that an unknown exception was encountered during Dual-write project validation. For assistance in resolving the error, reach out to Microsoft support with the exception details. |
| DIPV1002 | Dual-write only supports mapping between cross-company entities or company-specific entities from both sides | <p>The finance and operations apps entity used in the table map has [Cross-company data sharing](../../sysadmin/srs-overview.md) enabled. Dual-write isn't supported for an entity when cross-company data sharing is enabled. See [Limitations](../../sysadmin/srs-overview#limitations.md).</p><p>To resolve this error, either disable cross-company data sharing for the finance and operations apps entity or use a different entity for the table map.</p> |
| DIPV1003 | Integration keys are missing | <p>Integration keys must contain at least one field to uniquely identify a table record. Integration keys are required for both Dual-write and Data Integrator to work properly between Dataverse and finance and operations apps. The error indicates the Dataverse table used in the table map doesn't have an integration key defined.</p><p>To resolve this error: <ol><li> Open the [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com) of your Dataverse environment</li><li>Open the table defined in the table map</li><li>Define at least one alternate key for the Dataverse table.</li><li>If using Dual-write, in the Dual-write administration workspace in finance and operations apps, open the table map and select the **Refresh tables** action.</li></ol></p><p>For more information on integration keys, see [What is the purpose of the integration key, and is it mandatory?](../dual-write-faq.md#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-integration-key-and-is-it-mandatory) in the Dual-write frequently asked questions.</p> | 
| DIPV1004 | Integration key field isn't bi-directionally mapped | <p>The fields used in the integration key aren't all bi-directionally mapped. If a Dual-write table map is bi-directionally mapped, meaning that any of the field mappings are bi-directional between finance and operations apps and Dataverse, then ensure that all integration key fields are also bi-directionally mapped to ensure Dual-write live sync is able to locate a given record in either finance and operations apps or the Dataverse environment.</p><p>For more information on integration keys, see [What is the purpose of the integration key, and is it mandatory?](../dual-write-faq.md#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-integration-key-and-is-it-mandatory) in the Dual-write frequently asked questions.</p> | 
| DIPV1005 | Missing environment info for dataset | The error indicates that either the Dual-write connection or Data Integrator connection set is either misconfigured or corrupted. To resolve this error for Dual-write, reset the Dual-write connection set following the steps outlined in [Reset Dual-write connections](./reset.md). For Data Integrator, recreate the connection set following the steps in [How to create a connection set](/power-platform/admin/data-integrator#how-to-create-a-connection-set). | 
| DIPV1006 | Exceptions encountered during project validation | The error indicates that an unknown exception was encountered during Dual-write map validation or Data Integrator project validation. For assistance in resolving the error, reach out to Microsoft support with the exception details. |
| DIPV1007 | Task has environment that doesn't exist in the connection set | The error indicates the integration project is either misconfigured or corrupted. To resolve this error, recreate the data integration project following the steps outlined in [How to set up a data integration project](/power-platform/admin/data-integrator#how-to-set-up-a-data-integration-project). | 
| DIPV1008 | Data partition isn't valid | The organization mapping in the connection set used by the Data Integrator project becomes invalid after the customer deletes or changes the name of the business unit in Dataverse or legal entity in finance and operations apps.</p><p>To resolve this error, either readd or rename the missing business unit or legal entity, or recreate the connection set and data integration project following the steps outlined in [How to set up a data integration project](/power-platform/admin/data-integrator#how-to-set-up-a-data-integration-project). |
| DIPV1010 | Mandatory field in destination entity must be mapped | <p>A mandatory field is one that requires a field value to be provided when a table record is created through Dual-write. The error indicates that all mandatory fields aren't being mapped. This causes runtime failure when the Dual-write maps are synced during transaction processing.</p><p>To resolve this error ensure that all mandatory fields in the table are properly mapped to a related field on the target platform.</p> |
| DIPV1011 | Readonly field in destination entity must not be mapped | <p>A read-only field is one that can't have a value set in either create or update operations with Dual-write. The error indicates that at least one read-only field is incorrectly being mapped, which causes runtime failure when the Dual-write maps are synced during transaction processing.</p><p>To resolve this error, ensure that read-only fields aren't configured for bi-directional mapping.</p> |
| DIPV1012 | Error occurred while parsing Dataverse entity source filter | <p>The error indicates that the Dataverse source filter either has syntax errors or has references to invalid fields.</p><p>To resolve this error, ensure the proper syntax is used for defining the source filter for the Dataverse entity. See [Filter your data](customizing-mappings.md#filter-your-data) for more information.</p>  |
| DIPV1014 | Mapping is missing for integration key | The error indicates that all fields of integration key aren't properly mapped, or missing field mappings. Ensure that all integration key fields are mapped so the correct records can be located in the Dual-write sync. For more information on integration keys, see [What is the purpose of the integration key, and is it mandatory?](../dual-write-faq.md#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-integration-key-and-is-it-mandatory) in the Dual-write frequently asked questions. |
| DIPV1015 | Mapping is missing for integration key for lookup field | This error indicates that the expanded fields (key fields of the referenced entity) aren't mapped. If a lookup field is used as part of the integration key, the expanded fields (key field of the referenced entity) must also be mapped. |
| DIPV1016 | Missing Organization mapping for destination entity | The error indicates that either the Dual-write connection or Data Integrator connection set is either misconfigured or corrupted. To resolve this error for Dual-write, reset the Dual-write connection set following the steps outlined in [Reset Dual-write connections](./reset.md). For Data Integrator, recreate the connection set following the steps in [How to create a connection set](/power-platform/admin/data-integrator#how-to-create-a-connection-set). |
| DIPV1017 | Missing Organization mapping for related entity | The error indicates that either the Dual-write connection or Data Integrator connection set is either misconfigured or corrupted. To resolve this error for Dual-write, reset the Dual-write connection set following the steps outlined in [Reset Dual-write connections](./reset.md). For Data Integrator, recreate the connection set following the steps in [How to create a connection set](/power-platform/admin/data-integrator#how-to-create-a-connection-set). |
| DIPV1018 | Missing source schema | <p>The error indicates that the there's no cached metadata for the table.</p><p>To resolve this error, in the Dual-write administration workspace in finance and operations apps, open the table map and select the **Refresh tables** action. If the source is a table in finance and operations apps, find additional information on ensuring the schema is updated in [How to ensure data integration is using the most current finance and operations schema](dual-write-troubleshooting.md#how-to-ensure-data-integration-is-using-the-most-current-finance-and-operations-schema).</p> |
| DIPV1019 | Export can't be performed on the table due to the missing `versionnumber` field | The error indicates that the mapped Dataverse table doesn't have a `versionnumber` field. The table is of a type that isn't supported in Data Integrator or Dual-write, such as virtual entities or elastic tables. To resolve this error, enable the `versionnumber` field on the table, or select a table of a supported type. |
| DIPV1020 | Missing destination schema | <p>The error indicates that there isn't cached metadata for the table.</p><p>To resolve this error, in the Dual-write administration workspace in finance and operations apps, open the table map and select the **Refresh tables** action. If the source is a table in finance and operations apps, find additional information on ensuring the schema is updated in [How to ensure data integration is using the most current finance and operations schema](dual-write-troubleshooting.md#how-to-ensure-data-integration-is-using-the-most-current-finance-and-operations-schema).</p> |
| DIPV1021 | Missing source field in the mapping | The error indicates that the source field isn't set for the field map. To resolve this error, add the source field or use the **Default value transform** option if the source field isn't required. |
| DIPV1022 | Missing source field in the schema | <p>The error indicates that the source field used in the field mapping doesn't have presence in the cached metadata.</p><p>To resolve this error, in the Dual-write administration workspace in finance and operations apps, open the table map and select the **Refresh tables** action. If the source is a table in finance and operations apps, find additional information on ensuring the schema is updated in [How to ensure data integration is using the most current finance and operations schema](dual-write-troubleshooting.md#how-to-ensure-data-integration-is-using-the-most-current-finance-and-operations-schema).</p> |
| DIPV1023 | Duplicate source fields | The error indicates that a same field is used more than once in bi-directional field mappings. To resolve this error, remove the duplicate field mapping from the table map. |
| DIPV1024 | Missing destination field in the mapping | The error indicates that the destination field isn't set for the field mapping. Destination field must be set for data integration to work properly. To resolve this error, ensure the destination fields of all field maps are set. |
| DIPV1025 | Missing destination field in the schema | <p>This error indicates that the destination field used in the field mapping isn't present in the cached metadata.</p><p>To resolve this error, in the Dual-write administration workspace in finance and operations apps, open the table map and select the **Refresh tables** action. If the source is a table in finance and operations apps, find additional information on ensuring the schema is updated in [How to ensure data integration is using the most current finance and operations schema](dual-write-troubleshooting.md#how-to-ensure-data-integration-is-using-the-most-current-finance-and-operations-schema).</p>  |
| DIPV1026 | Duplicate destination fields | The error indicates that a same field is used more than once as the destination field in table field maps. To resolve this error, remove the duplicate field mapping from the table map. |
| DIPV1027 | Map the integration key associated with the entity lookup field to the destination field | This error indicates a mapping is missing for the integration key for a destination lookup field. The expanded fields (key fields of the referenced entity) aren't being mapped. |
| DIPV1028 | Map the integration key associated with the entity lookup field to the source field | This error indicates a mapping is missing for the integration key for a source lookup field. The expanded fields (key fields of the referenced entity) aren't being mapped. |
| DIPV1029 | Duplicate value map | The error indicates that there are two field maps that use the same pair of source and destination fields. To resolve this error, locate and remove all duplicates in the map. |
| DIPV1030 | Data type mismatch | The error indicates the data type of source field isn't compatible with the destination field. This causes runtime sync failure or potential data loss. Based on the error message details, either change the data types of the fields or choose a different pair of fields with compatible data types. |
| DIPV1031 | Missing default transform for mandatory destination field | The error indicates that default transform should be applied if a mandatory field is used as the destination field. The lack of the default transform causes runtime sync failures during integration processing. To resolve this error add the default transform that ensures a default value for the mandatory field. |
