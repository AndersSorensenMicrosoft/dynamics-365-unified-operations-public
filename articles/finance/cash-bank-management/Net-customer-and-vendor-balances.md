# Net customer and vendor balances

Customer and vendor balance netting is a process where the balances for a vendor and customer are netted against each other because the vendor and customer are the same party. This approach minimizes the exchange of money between an organization and the customer or vendor party. It can also help a company avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and save on transaction fees, by consolidating the companyâ€™s customer and vendor balances.

This article provides an overview of the customer and vendor balances netting process in Dynamics 365 Finance. This article also explains how to set up the netting agreement, manual net customer and vendor balances, automatic net customer and vendor balances, and reverse posted netting transactions.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a preview feature in Dynamics 365 Finance 10.0.38. The feature is available in sandbox only and general availability date in Production environment will be announced later.
