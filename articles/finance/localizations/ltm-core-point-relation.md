# Sales point relation for sales documents and remission
You can select the packing slip documents to use with a sales document by linking sales points when you a invoice a product sale. Then, the sales points will be assigned to the invoice in the transaction.

## Prerequisites
Before you can link sales points, you must create at least one sale point. Additionally, a sales invoice document class and a packing slip document class must be created and must have an automatic generated document number mask with a sales point assigned.

## Set up a sales point pair
1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **LATAM** > **Sales Point Relation - Sales document and Remission**.
2. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a line on the main grid.
3. In the **Sales document sales point** field, select a sales point.
4. In the **Remission sales point** field, select a sales point.
5. Select **Save**.
