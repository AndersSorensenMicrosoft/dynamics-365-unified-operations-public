## Prerequisites

To use natural-language inventory search with Copilot, your system must meet the following requirement:

- You must be running Inventory Visibility version 1.2.2.54 or newer.

## Use the query API

You submit inventory queries and receive results using the query API, which is defined as follows:

```txt
Path:
    /nl/iv/{environmentId}/query
Method:
    Post
Headers:
    Api-Version="1.0"
Authorization="Bearer $access_token"
x-ms-client-session-id={ your session id }       // New session Id will clear chat history. 
ContentType:
    application/json
Body:
    {
        "Text" : { Your text input }
    }
```

The path URL should resemble the following example: `https://inventoryservice-copilot.weu-il301.gateway.prod.island.powerapps.com/nl/iv/{{Supply_Chain_Management_environment_id}}/query`.

The following example shows sample body content.

```json
   {
        "Text" : "What's the inventory of product D0001 in organization USMF, site 1, location 11?"
   }
```

You can choose a level of logging detail for the request by adding the optional `LogLevel` parameter in the body and setting it to `Debug`, `Trace`, or `Information`.
