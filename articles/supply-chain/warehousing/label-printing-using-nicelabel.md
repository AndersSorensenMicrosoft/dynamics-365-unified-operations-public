# Enable label printing using the external Loftware NiceLabel label service solution

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to enable label printing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management using Loftware NiceLabel solution. 
 
Loftware NiceLabel offers capabilities to create, manage, and print standardized, compliant barcode labels. In addition, enables printing labels to supported cloud connected printers or a wide variety of classic on-premises printers. NiceLabel has several products available that can be used together with the External label printing service, including their cloud solution, NiceLabel Cloud, as well as several editions of their on premises products. In this guide, we will focus on integration with the NiceLabel Cloud solution, however parts of the guide that use NiceLabel Automation can be used with other products as well.
For more details about Loftware NiceLabel Cloud, visit [Loftware NiceLabel](https://www.loftware.com/products/labeling/nicelabel-cloud).

By enabling the external service integration, you are affirming that you understand that the data handling, privacy, and compliance standards of the external service may not be the same as those provided by Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. Please consult the external service's documentation and terms to learn whether your organization's security and privacy requirements are met by the external service, including the handling of personal data and geo-residency. Your privacy is important to us. To learn more, read our [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement). 

**NiceLabel Cloud** supports two integration approaches for other cloud applications:

- **Via the Cloud Print API**, where the NiceLabel Cloud performs the label generation and sends the print job to the printer. This can be either a so-called Cloud printer (a printer connected directly to the NiceLabel Cloud instance, without using any locally installed software or printer driver), or any printer that is connected to a workstation with a print gateway component installed. For the current list of supported Cloud printers, refer to the Loftware web site.
- **Via the Cloud Trigger API**, where the NiceLabel Cloud sends the message to an on-premises NiceLabel Automation instance, which performs the label generation and sends the label to the printer. You must install a Windows printer driver for each of your printers.

If you don’t want any local software footprint, then the use of Cloud Print API with supported printers is the preferred option. Otherwise, we suggest using the Cloud Trigger API as the preferred option, but both options are available. 

Some of the pros and cons of each of the options are listed here:
- Using Cloud Trigger API, you can use an out of the box Label Cloud Integration pack or completely customize the processing of the print request.
- Cloud Print API is synchronous (the server waits for the print engine to print the label) and reports the outcome of the print job, but Dynamics 365 SCM (Supply Chain Management) does not use this result. This means that you will need to wait a slightly longer time when printing labels or set a timeout on the external service operation. In case of the timeout, the Cloud Print API will continue printing, but the request will be logged as a timeout.
- On-premises printer naming is simpler in Cloud Trigger API, since you can use the names of the printers as they are configured on the server(s) running the NiceLabel Automation. For Cloud Print API, you must specify which workstation will be used to print and determine the workstation unique ID by using the Cloud Print API first.
- For Cloud Trigger API, it is possible to install multiple instances of NiceLabel Automation on the local network to achieve load balancing and high availability. As noted in the previous point, you need to specify which workstation the printing request will be routed to when using Cloud Print API and if that workstation is unavailable, the label will not print. Conversely, multiple NiceLabel Automation instances can handle requests to the same Cloud Trigger.
- The installation footprint is smaller with the Cloud Print API.

## NiceLabel Cloud integration preparation

Before NiceLabel Cloud can be accessed by either the Cloud Print API or the Cloud Trigger API, you must complete the registration on the Developer Portal and then link the Developer Portal subscription with your NiceLabel Cloud instance. The required steps are described on [NiceLabel Help Center](https://help.nicelabel.com/hc/en-001/articles/4402966072209-Cloud-Integrations#cloud-integrations-1-0).

If you wish to use IoT enabled printers, you need to connect them to your NiceLabel Cloud instance at this point. More information is available on [NiceLabel Help Center](https://help.nicelabel.com/hc/en-001/articles/4407466158737-Cloud-Printers).

## Configuring Microsoft Dynamics 365 SCM to print to Cloud printers using the Cloud Print API

Using the Cloud Print API, we can print both labels that are generated by the NiceLabel Cloud based on variables sent from Microsoft Dynamics 365 SCM or send a ZPL (Zebra Programming Language) label (perhaps an existing label layout or a shipping label received from the shipping carrier through a SPS integration). The External Service Definition will contain two operations, one for printing variables-based layouts and the second for printing ZPL-based label layouts. 

### Configure external service definition

Follow these steps to set up external service definition.

1.	Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> External services \> External service definitions**.
1.	On the Action Pane, select **New** to create an external service definition.
1.	Set the following values for the new service definition:
    - **External service definition** – Enter *NLPrint*.
    - **Description** – Enter *NiceLabel Cloud Print API*.
1.	Select **Edit operations** to define the *Print* service operation. Set the following values for the new service operation:
    -**External service operation** – Enter *Print*.
    -**Description** – Enter *Print to cloud printer*.
    -**HTTP method** – Select *POST* method.
    - **Operation timeout** - Select the operation timeout (for example, , *500*).
        > [!NOTE]
        > Cloud Print API is a synchronous API, that means that it will wait until the label has been printed and will provide immediate feedback whether the printing was successful or not. However, as this might take several seconds, it could provide a bad user experience for mobile device users. Additionally, the result is currently not used. Therefore the timeout has been set quite low; even though Microsoft Dynamics 365 SCM stops waiting after 500ms, the print is continuing in the background.
    - **Request body type** - Select *Raw*. 
    - **Relative URL** - Enter */Print/v2/Print*.
    - Expand **HTTP request headers** and create the following record:
        - **Key**: Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
        - **Value**: $auth.secret$ (exactly as written)
     - Expand **Request body** and create the following record:
        - **Content type**: Enter *application/json*
        - **Body**: 
            ```
            {
                "deviceType": "CloudPrinter",
                "deviceId": {
                    "printerName": "$label.printer$",
                    "workstation": null
                },
                $label.body$
            }
            ```
1. Create *SendData* service operation. Set the following values for the new service operation:
    -**External service operation** – Enter *SendData*.
    -**Description** – Enter *Send ZPL to cloud printer*.
    -**HTTP method** – Select *POST* method.
    - **Operation timeout** - Set the operation timeout (for example, , *500*).
    - **Request body type** - Select *Raw*. 
    - **Relative URL** - Enter */Print/v2/SendData*.
    - Expand **HTTP request headers** and create the following record:
        - **Key**: Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
        - **Value**: $auth.secret$ (exactly as written)
     - Expand **Request body** and create the following record:
        - **Content type**: Enter *application/json*
        - **Body**: 
            ```
            {
                "deviceType": "CloudPrinter",
                "deviceId": {
                    "printerName": "$label.printer$",
                    "workstation": null
                },
                "data": "$label.body:base64$"
            }
            ```
1. Go back to the **External service definition**.
1. Expand **Label print service** tab.
1. In the **Print operation** field select *SendData* that has been created.  
1. In the **Variables print operation** field select *Print* that has been created.  
1. In the **Variable label layout template** field set the following:
    ```
    "filePath": "$SystemVariables.LabelFile$",
    "quantity": "$SystemVariables.Quantity$",
    "dataSources": [
        {
    {{Row Table=LabelLayoutVariable
            "$LabelLayoutVariable.Variable$": "$LabelLayoutVariable.Value$",
    }}
        }
    ]
    ```

### Configure external service instance

You will need either the Primary or the Secondary key from the subscription you created earlier on the NiceLabel Cloud Development Portal. 

Follow these steps to set up external service instance.

1.	Go to **Warehouse Management \> Setup \> External services \> External service instances**.
1.	On the Action Pane, select **New** to create an external service instance.
1.	Set the following values for the new service instance:
    - **External service instance** - Enter a name for the instance (for example, *NLPrintProd*).
    - **Description** - Enter a short description of the instance (for example, *NiceLabel Cloud Print API Production*).
    - **External service definition** – Select the service definition to use. The example service definition value that was suggested earlier in this article was *NLPrint*.
1.	Expand **General** tab and set the following values:
    - **Base URL** - Set *https://labelcloudapi.onnicelabel.com*.
    - **Authentication secret** - Enter the subscription key from the NiceLabel developer portal.
    - **Logging level** - Select *Successes and errors*.
    - **Log request bodies** - Select *Successes and errors*.

You can now proceed to create label printers and label layouts using either variables or ZPL.
> [!NOTE]
> When creating label printers, use the name of the printer from the Cloud printers tab in NiceLabel Cloud Control Center for the “Label print service printer name” field.

> [!NOTE]
> When creating label layouts using variables, use the full path and file name of the label (as seen in the Path field in File Properties) for the LabelFile system variable.

## Configuring Microsoft Dynamics 365 SCM to print to local network printers using the Cloud Trigger API

Using the Cloud Trigger API, we can call an on-premise installation of the NiceLabel Automation service, which then processes the request and performs preprogrammed actions. Before proceeding with the following steps, install NiceLabel on one or more computers that will run the NiceLabel Automation. Ensure that you have all the label printers installed on these machines as well. For guidance on installation and printer setup, refer to NiceLabel documentation.

To simplify the configuration of the NiceLabel Automation, we will use the NiceLabel Cloud Data Integration pack and the steps described in [NiceLabel Help Center](https://help.nicelabel.com/hc/en-001/articles/7361192275217-Appendix-A-Integration-bundle). The required steps are summarized below with more details provided in the document:

1. Download the integration pack from the URL in the document.
1. Log in to your NiceLabel Control Center.
1. In Documents, create a new folder /Demo/LabelCloudDataIntegration.
1. Open the integration pack ZIP file and extract the files.
1. Upload your Document Storage folder contents into your CloudIntegration folder in your DMS (Document Management System).
1. On the computer where NiceLabel Automation is installed, open the NiceLabel Automation Manager.
1. If not activated yet, connect the NiceLabel Automation to your NiceLabel Cloud.
1. In NiceLabel Automation Manager, select +Add and browse to the LabelCloudDataIntegration folder on the NiceLabel Cloud.
1. Open the CloudIntegration-CloudTrigger.misx file.
1. Start only the Print trigger (verify that it is using the Unique identifier Api-CloudIntegrationDemo-Print); other triggers are not currently used by Microsoft Dynamics 365 SCM.

After you have installed and started the Print trigger, we can configure the External Service Definition and External Service Instance required to access the NiceLabel Automation using the Cloud Trigger API. Without customizing the demo automation configuration, we can only print labels defined using variables, therefore we will be only configuring one operation on the External Service Definition. Use the following steps to create the definition and instance:

    - **Operation timeout** - Select the operation timeout (for example, , *500*).
    - **Request body type** - Select *Raw*. 
    - **Relative URL** - Enter */Trigger/v1/CloudTrigger/Api-CloudIntegrationDemo-Print*.
    - Expand **HTTP request headers** and create the following record:
        - **Key**: Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
        - **Value**: $auth.secret$ (exactly as written)
     - Expand **Request body** and create the following record:
        - **Content type**: Enter *application/json*
        - **Body**: 
            ```
            {
                "Printer": "$label.printer$",
                $label.body$
            }
            ```
1. Go back to the **External service definition**.
1. Expand **Label print service** tab.
1. In the **Print operation** field do not select anything.  
1. In the **Variables print operation** field select *Print* that has been created.  
1. In the **Variable label layout template** field set the following:
    ```
    "FilePath": "$SystemVariables.LabelFile$",
    "Quantity": "$SystemVariables.Quantity$",
    "Variables": [
    {{Row Table=LabelLayoutVariable
        { 
        "Name": "$LabelLayoutVariable.Variable$",
        "Value": "$LabelLayoutVariable.Value$"
        },
    }}
    ]
    ```

### Configure external service instance
