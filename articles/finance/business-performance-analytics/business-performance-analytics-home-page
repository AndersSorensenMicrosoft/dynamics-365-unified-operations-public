# About Business performance analytics

Business performance analytics (BPA) simplifies the process of gaining insights from data, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly view across multiple business processes, and delivering insights directly to all users, regardless of technical ability. 
Finance professionals can make informed decisions without needing advanced skills or data science understanding, enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives while streamlining regular financial reporting and shortening cycle times.
This solution enhances the potential of Dynamics 365 Finance capabilities by leveraging unified data for AI and machine learning, enabling teams to automatically identify opportunities to improve financial performance. With AI-powered solutions, Microsoft can help protect organizations from risk and guard against future disruption, leveraging its partnership with Open AI and recent acquisitions in business domains like process mining and AI-driven spend analytics.
BPA enables reporting in a more holistic, less siloed way across multiple systems of record by normalizing data. Built on the Microsoft Dataverse, it includes a web-based reporting hub where end users can create reporting via Excel, Power BI, and other templates, empowering all users to easily access and analyze data. 

> [!NOTE]
> BPA will be publicly available starting in May of 2023
