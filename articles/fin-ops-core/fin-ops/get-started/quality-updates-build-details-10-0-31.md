# 10.0.31 PQU release 3 build information

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

| Update ID | Build Version | Title | Problem Description | Solution |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 102629 | 7.0.6801.75 | Enabling duplicate record sharing policy fails with underlying query timeout (Revised). | Direct sql queries executed in managed stack receive a default timeout of 30 seconds. When a policy includes customers or vendors, and data size is big, data sharing validation runs a direct SQL command in managed stack. There timeout of 30 seconds is often not enough and policy enablement will fail with &quot;An error occured when executing update statement&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;  | The fix applies timeout of 5 minutes to direct sql queries as well.&nbsp;  |
| 102627 | 7.0.6801.76 | Reduce impact of a research call when drilling into a record on a Details form | If a user is on a Details form (that technically contains both the list and details user experiences) and the user drills into a record in the middle of the dataset, if the view that's loaded on the details side of the form contains added fields, the form query will be re-executed to ensure the values for the added fields are available to show in the form. This execution of the query on this transition can be slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;  | The current fix helps to reduce calls for query execution when navigating from list to details within a Details form multiple times while the form is open. When navigating from the list portion of the page to the details portions of the page, if the default view for the details page has at least one added field, the form's query will be executed for the first transition to details. All subsequent navigations to the details page while that same form instance is open will not require a retrigger of the query.&nbsp;  So for example, if the default view on the details page of Customers has added fields, the following behavior will occur with this change. If the user is viewing the list of customers and drills into a record, the transition to the details side will result in a re-execution of the query to retrieve data for the added fields. If the user goes back to the list and then drills into another record, there will be no re-execution of the query. This behavior will persist for the user until the form is opened again.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Note these changes are only applicable to the &quot;Saved view performance enhancement&quot; feature.&nbsp;  |
| 102600 | 10.0.1406.177 | Last Known Good (LKG) - Version 10.0.31 of Finance and Operations apps | This is the final quality update for version 10.0.31 of Finance and Operations apps, which reached end of service.

| 102412 | 10.0.1406.173 | When created Purchase order in company which set up intercompany, purchase order is not created unless sales order is clicked. | The customer created purchase order by manual in the company which set up intercompany. Unless they click sales order in sales company, purchase order is not created automatically.   | The linked intercompany orders are now being created automatically.

| 102351 | 7.0.6801.69 | FnO Virtual Entity Odata Actions will not be available if they use Memo types | FnO Virtual Entity Odata Actions will not be available if the action uses any Memo types.  This will surface as the action not being available to invoke from a Dataverse flow when trying to &quot;Perform a bound action&quot; on an FnO virtualized entity.  | This fix addresses the issue with Virtual Entity Odata action support of Memo string fields.

| 102264 | 10.0.1406.174 | Payment Advice is sent to the wrong vendor via email | Payment Advice is sent to the wrong vendor via email   | The issue is caused by unexpected retry after the error is caught due to invalid email address.

| 102256 | 7.0.6801.66 | Fixing Export Parametrization issue with multiple filters | When parameterizing queries with multiple filters, the parameters were not getting copied to match the number of parameter spots in the query.

But when it is disabled the line amount is displayed correctly | Line Amount is displayed zero on the Sales invoice report when Revenue recognition feature is enabled.  | The issue was mitigated by turning off the flight&nbsp;RevRecSalesInvoiceReportFlight. This flight was protecting the change related to the item amount on the sales invoice report when prices on the sales order are inclusive of taxes. The latest fix would be available through a quality update. Also, the customer would have to request for enabling the original flight if and only if they use the tax inclusivity option on the sales order.  |
| 102177 | 10.0.1406.164 | Sales order history shows an error message | In some cases, customers go to their sales order history, and see an error message: &quot;something went wrong. Please try again later.&quot;  This is a generic message, one of the reasons is that products in a sales order might not be available for the customer anyone.  | This fix solves the problem for any case a product is not available, in these cases, the sales order history will properly show to the customer.

On a free text invoice,&nbsp;you should be able to print the business document and also generate an electronic reporting job for the XML 'UBL Sales invoice BE' (standard format of Microsoft) which works as expected.&nbsp;But when an electronic reporting destination (in 'electronic reporting destinations') is added only the business document is printed and no electronic job is triggered for the einvoice.&nbsp;When no electronic reporting destination is added (and only the template is chosen on the print management via 'form setup'), an electronic reporting job is created.   | The issue has been solved.

| 102000 | 10.0.1406.171 | Update to Sales order balance that is less than the original Credit card authorization creates a rogue authorization that never gets removed. | System is unable to perform a linked refund in POS due to rogue authorization.   | For cash, check and currency payments, always post the payment by the amount of the payment received during order completion (Prepayments and non-prepayments), and account for overpayments.&nbsp;For credit card, gift card and loyalty prepayments, capture up to the total sales amount.&nbsp;Remove extra credit card authorization for underpayment when order is fully invoiced |

In case there is posted summarized Fixed Asset depreciation for multiple years and posting date was not end of a fiscal year, plan for future depreciation (profile) is inconsistent.&nbsp;  | Potential workaround for this issue requires posting summarized depreciation for full fiscal years and in last fiscal year period. Transactions should be separated per single fiscal year. Microsoft works on solution to split summarized depreciation per fiscal year instead of posting single transaction for multiple years to avoid issues with calculation of future depreciations.  |
| 101927 | 10.0.1406.164 | Batch task error causing failure of consolidation processing. Deadlock issue. | A consolidation is performed, using a batch.

| 101805 | 7.0.6801.58 | Telemetry enhancements to get passthrough users | Currently, we are missing telemetry that could help us figure out whether a scenario is passthrough or not. This would help us fix a security bug.  | This fix ensures that we have enough telemetry to get all passthrough scenarios.  |
| 101784 | 10.0.1406.164 | Incorrect exchange rate printed in the customer invoice report | For Poland, when fixed exchange rate is used, the posted invoice report does not display the fixed exchange rate value from sales order but takes it from defined system exchange rates.  | Correct exchange rate will be displayed in the posted invoice report.  |
| 101777 | 7.0.6801.57 | SysSetupInstaller batch jobs are in error Status after upgrade to 10.0.32 | SysSetupInstaller batch jobs are failing and moved to error Status after upgrade to 10.0.32.

If you open that dropdown, a &quot;Column is not filterable&quot; message appears. | Generically, the issue occurs when a user navigates to a page with an embedded part form. In this situation, the user will then not be able to filter either through the filter pane or the grid if the filtering is performed anywhere outside the part form. The issue was caused by a reordering of DOM elements in the client, which impacted&nbsp;logic for retrieving a correct filtering context for a given form.  This fix ensures the correct filter contexts are applied to the parent form or part form on creation of each filter context.  |
| 101747 | 10.0.1406.172 | [Commerce] Slow queries on GetCustomerBalance API | A performance issue was introduced in 10.0.31, which would slow down the API Commerce/GetCustomerBalance.

| 101712 | 7.0.6801.56 | Enabling duplicate record sharing policy fails with underlying query timeout. | In some cases sql query timeout is unexpectedly set to default .Net 30 seconds for queries issued by policy enabling process. When a policy includes customers or vendors, and data size is big, timeout of 30 seconds is often not enough and policy enablement will fail with &quot;An error occured when executing update statement&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;   | The fix assigns timeout to 5 minutes.  |
