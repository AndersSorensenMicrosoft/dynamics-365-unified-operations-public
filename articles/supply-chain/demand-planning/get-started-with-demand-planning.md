# Get started with Demand Planning

The Demand Planning app follows the demand planning process explained on the overview page, and when installed it will automatically load demo data.

## Explore Demand Planning functionality using demo data

When you install the Demand Planning app, it will automatically open the **Get Started** page and load demo data, so no action is needed from your side. You'll have to wait until the demo data is installed to start exploring the application.

If at any point in time, you would like to start with the fresh demo data again, from the **Get started** page, select **Reset trial with sample data**.

## Use the app with your own data

Once you have gotten familiar with the application and how it works, you may want to start using your own data. Then, you can easily cleanup all data that is existing on the system (demo data and any other data you may have created until that moment) by selecting **Delete all data** from the **Get started** page.

## Connect Demand Planning with your Supply Chain Management 

If you want to import your own data into the Demand planning app or export the forecast into Supply Chain Management, then these two must be connected.

This should be automatically setup when the connection is done.

The environment must be in the same tenant!!!
