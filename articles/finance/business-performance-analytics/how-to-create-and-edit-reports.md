# How to create and edit business performance analytics reports
Business performance analytics gives you the ability to create or customize reports with data fields you are interested in. You may also change any visuals in the reports. 

## Create a new report
To create a new report, go to **Reports** in the **Data explorer** section of business performance analytics. 
Select one of the following options: 
 - **Start with a blank report**: Select this option to open an empty Power BI embedded report containing your Power BI dataset. You can then start building the report to your liking. 
 - **Duplicate a Microsoft report**: Select this option to pick a report from a list of reports that are available in business performance analytics. These reports can be modified if needed.  

### Edit a report
After you open a report, you may edit its visuals or data fields using **Edit**. One exception are reports with type **Microsoft** that can't be edited. You must duplicate this report and edit the duplicated copy. 

### Duplicate a aeport  
To duplicate a report, go to **Reports** in the **Data explorer** section of business performance analytics. Select the report to duplicate. You may only select one report at a time. Click **Duplicate** on the **Reports** page. This duplicated version will become available on the **Reports** page. 
You may also duplicate a report that you already have open by clicking **Duplicate** button on the report. Once the report is duplicated, you will receive a **Report duplicated** message with a link to the duplicated report.

### Rename a report
To rename a report, go to **Reports** page in the **Data explorer** section of business performance analytics. Select the report to rename. You may only select one report at a time. Click **Rename** on the **Reports** page. You will rename and save the new report name. You may also rename a report that you already have open by clicking **Rename** on the report. 

### Delete a report
You can't delete reports with type “Microsoft”. You can only delete reports with type **Custom**. 
To delete a report: 
1.	Go to the **Reports** page in the **Data explorer** section of business performance analytics. Select the report to delete and click **Delete**. 
2.	You may delete multiple reports at once.
