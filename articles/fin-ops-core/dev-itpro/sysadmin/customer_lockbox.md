# Use Customer Lockbox to manage secure access to customer data

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

Most operations, support, and troubleshooting performed by Microsoft personnel (including subprocessors) don't require access to customer data. However, in those rare situations where this access is required, Power Platform Customer Lockbox lets you review and approve (or reject) data access requests. Use it when a Microsoft engineer needs to access customer data, whether in response to a customer-initiated support ticket or a problem identified by Microsoft.

This article explains how to set up Customer Lockbox and how access requests are initiated, tracked, and stored for later reviews and audits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Customer Lockbox is provided through Microsoft Power Platform. It applies to environments running one or more finance and operations apps that are integrated with Power Platform, including all environment specific resources (SQL DBs and Storage Account). (See also: [Enable the Microsoft Power Platform integration](../../dev-itpro/power-platform/enable-power-platform-integration.md).)
> - The preview version of Customer Lockbox is available at no cost. When Customer Lockbox becomes generally available, there will be a cost associated with environments where it is enabled.
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that Microsoft customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is being gradually rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

## Summary

You can enable Customer Lockbox as required for the data sources on your tenant. For the duration of the preview, Customer Lockbox will apply to all environments on the respective tenant.
