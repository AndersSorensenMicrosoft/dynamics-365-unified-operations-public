# Customer data maintenance

On a customer record the **Rename** function is used to rename the unique record of a customer. This will update all references from an old name to the new name entered. This action can fail for a number of reasons related to table structure and the amount of data. 

This feature **Customer account rename data maintenance** will allow the out of sync records (the ones with the old account) to continue processing so all records are updated to the new name. 

In the **Feature management** workspace, select All, then search for **Customer account rename data maintenance**. Select the record and then select **Enable Now**. 

Navigate to the Customer account rename data maintenence page under **Credit and collections > Inquiries and reports > Data maintenance > Customer account rename data maintenance**. Any records that have not been updated will be shown. Select the record to contine the rename process.
