# Configure Business performance analytics

## Configuration of Business Performance analytics 

To successfully complete the procedures for setting up Business performance analytics, please follow below steps on order. You must have System administrator and System Customizer access in the [Power Portal admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), System Administrator access in Dynamics 365 Finance, and access to create environments in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). 

## Configure Dataverse 

Follow these steps to configure Dataverse for Business performance analytics. 
In LCS, open the environment page, and verify that the Power Platform Integration section is already set up. 
If Dataverse has already been set up, the Dataverse environment name that is linked to the Finance environment should be listed. 
If Dataverse hasn't yet been set up, select Setup. Setup of the Dataverse environment can take up to an hour. When the setup has been successfully completed, the Dataverse environment name that is linked to in the Finance environment should be listed. 
If this integration was set up with an existing Microsoft Power Platform environment, contact your administrator to make sure that the linked environment isn't in the disabled state. For more information see [Enable Power Platform Integeration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/enable-power-platform-integration). To access the Microsoft Power Platform admin site, go to [link](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments).

## Configure your Azure AD Tenant 

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must be configured so that it can be used with Dataverse and the Microsoft Power Platform applications. This configuration requires that either the Project Owner role or the Environment Manager role be assigned to the user in the Project security role field in LCS. Verify that the following setup is completed: 
 1. You have System administrator and System Customizer access in the Power Portal admin center. 
 2. A Dynamics 365 Finance or equivalent license is applied to the user who is installing Business performance analytic

## Steps for Data Movement from Prod to Sandbox 
Follow steps mentioned in below link to move data from production to sandbox. This data will be loaded in the Business performance analytics app and pre requisite before App Installation.  

For instructions on the data movement please refer to this link [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/database/dbmovement-operations).

## Check the required configs are being enabled: 

Ensure that the following config is enabled on environment. This could be validated by logging into Finance and navigate to System Administration -> Setup -> License Configuration. 
The following config needs to be enabled/validate to be enabled before triggering app installation. Required for R2R (Record-to-Report).  
 - Sql row version change tracking (preview) 
 - General ledger
 - Budget
 - Reversing entries
 If any of the above configs are not enabled, ensure that we enable them before installing the app. To enable the configs, it requires the system to be in maintenance mode.  
 
 ## How to turn on maintenance mode using LCS  

Login to LCS, navigate to your environment, On the menu, click on Maintain and then click on Enable maintenance mode.
