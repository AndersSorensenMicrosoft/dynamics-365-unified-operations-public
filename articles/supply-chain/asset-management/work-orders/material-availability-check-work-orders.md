<!--KFM: Preview until further notice -->

Supervisors can make a material availability check on work orders. This process is relevant for organizations that want to confirm that all of the required spare parts are available before workers start maintenance work. For example, a supervisor might be responsible for all corrective maintenance on a manufacturing site. As a standard procedure, the supervisor checks whether all materials required for each work order are available before releasing them to maintenance workers for processing.

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, your system must meet the following requirements:

- You must be running Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management 10.0.37 or later.
- The feature that is named *(Preview) Material availability check on maintenance work orders* must be turned on in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## How the material availability check works

The material availability check for work orders uses a standard master planning run to calculate the inventory availability of all required materials. Material demand for work orders is generated by journal lines in the project item journal related to each work order. A journal line can be created or copied from the work order's item forecast. See also [Maintenance forecasts](maintenance-forecasts.md).

Supervisors use a dedicated page to run the material availability check for a selected range of work orders. From this page, supervisors can run the master plan and then read the material availability status for each of the selected work orders. The page also provides information about material availability of the individual spare parts required for the selected work orders.

## Check material availability for work orders

Follow these steps to check material availability for work orders.

1. Go to **Asset management \> Work orders \> All work orders**.

1. Use the **Filter** field and column-header filters to select the range of work orders you want to check for material availability. All orders shown on the page will be checked.

1. On the Paction pane, open the **Work Order** tab and select **Material availability check** to open the **Material availability check** page.

    > [!TIP]
    >The **Material availability check** page is divided into two sections. The **Work orders** section shows the work orders. The **On-hand inventory** section shows journal lines relating to the selected work order.

1. Select a work order in the upper grid. Check whether the order shows a checkmark in the **journal lines** column. If not, choose *one* of the following methods to create the journal lines:

    - **Create the journal lines from a forecast:**
        1. Select **Forecast** from the toolbar to open the **Work order maintenance forecast** page.
        1. Expand the **Items** FastTab and check whether there are any item forecast lines for the order. If there are no lines, you can add them by selecting **Add**, **Add spare parts** or **Add BOM items** from the toolbar.
            > [!TIP]
            > You can set up the system to automatically generate item forecast lines for work orders by setting up default forecasts on the **Maintenance job type defaults** page.
        1. Close the **Work order maintenance forecast** page to return to the **Work order material availability check** page.
        1. Select **Copy journals from forecast** from the toolbar to open the **Copy from forecast** dialog and set the **Item** field to **Yes**
        1. Select **OK** in the dialog.
        1. Select the **Refresh** button at the top of the page.
        1. Verify that the work order now has a journal line by confirming that there is a checkmark in the **Journal lines created** column.

    - **Create the journal from the Work order journals page:**
        1. Select **Journals** from the toolbar to open the **Work order journals** page.
        1. In the **Items** FastTab add a line in the grid.
        1. Close the **Work order journals** page to return to the **Work order material availability check** page.
        1. Select the **Refresh** button at the top of the page.
        1. Verify that the work order now has a journal line by confirming that there is a checkmark in the **Journal lines created** column.

1. After you have verified that the work order has journal lines, run the material availability check by selecting **Material availability check** from the toolbar.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can select multiple work orders for the material availability check.

1. The **Material availability check** dialog opens. Make the following settings:

    - **Run mode** – Select the type of check you want to conduct. Choose one of the following settings:
        - *Master planning + Availability check* – The check runs master planning for the products relating to the work orders and then runs a material availability check for the orders based on the master planning result.
        - *Availability check only* – The check is run based on data from the latest version of the master planning.
    - **Plan** – Select the master plan to use when running master planning. Normally the master plan representing the dynamics master plan will be used.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're just exploring the feature for now (for example using [demo data](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/demo-data.md)), then select *Master planning + Availability check*.

1. Select **OK** to run the check.

1. The **Work orders** section of the **Work order material availability** page now indicates the material availability status of each selected work order by showing one of the following icons in the **Ready to be released** column:

    | Icon | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | :::image type="icon" source="media/material-check-unknown.png" border="false"::: | The check couldn't be run for this work order because there is no material demand for it. Make sure there is a journal line for the order. |
    | :::image type="icon" source="media/material-check-available.png" border="false"::: | All materials for the work order are fully available. |
    | :::image type="icon" source="media/material-check-warning.png" border="false"::: | Some or all of the materials for the work order aren't available. |

1. Select a work order in the **Work orders** section. The **On-hand inventory** section now indicates the availability of each material for the selected work order by showing one of the following icons in the **Material availability** column:

    | Icon | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | :::image type="icon" source="media/material-check-available.png" border="false"::: | The required material is fully available. For material in this status, the quantity in the **Requested quantity** field, which is the quantity requested by the work order, equals the quantity in the **On-hand settled** field. |
    | :::image type="icon" source="media/material-check-warning.png" border="false"::: | The required material is unavailable or only partially available. In this status, the **Requested quantity** is not fully covered by the **On-hand settled**, but is instead covered by a combination of the **On-hand settled**, **Planned order settled** quantity, and/or **Order settled** quantity.

    > [!TIP]
    > To get more information about how the demand for the requested quantity is covered, select **Inventory \> Explosion** from the **On-hand inventory** section toolbar.

1. Your material availability check is now complete. If you like, you can now update the state of orders that are ready to be worked on by maintenance workers, as described in the next section

## Update a work order state

Once you have confirmed that all materials are available for a work order, you can update the work order state to indicate that the order is ready to be worked on by maintenance workers. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If you aren't already there, open the **Material availability check** page, as described in the previous section.
1. To get help finding the work orders you're looking for, you can use **Material availability** field to filter the work orders in the **Work orders** section. Select one of the following options:
    - *All* - Show all work orders
    - *Upcoming* - Only show work orders where some or all materials are not available
    - *Available* - Only show work orders where all materials are available. These orders are ready to be worked on by maintenance workers.

    For this procedure, select *Available* to show the work orders where all materials are available. You can now change the work order state of these orders to indicate that they are ready to be worked on by maintenance workers.

1. In the **Work orders** section, select one or more orders that you want to update.
1. Select **Update work order state** from the toolbar to open the **Update work order state** dialog.
1. Select the next work order state for the selected work orders.
1. Select **OK** to confirm.
