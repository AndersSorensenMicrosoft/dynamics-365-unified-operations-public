# Setting up Apple Pay with Adyen in Dynamics 365 Commerce

This topic provides an overview of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 payments support for accepting payments via Apple Pay on supported devices.

## Key terms

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| Apple Pay | Also known as the Apple Pay "button", Apple Pay is a wallet payment offering supported through the Adyen connector, allowing the customer experience and integration supported by the **Dynamic's 365 Apple Pay Connector**. |
| Wallet | A payment type that does not include traditional payment characteristics, such as the BIN range and expiration date, which are used to differentiate among credit and debit card types. |

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce offers an out-of-box integration for Apple Pay when using the Adyen payment gateway service. Apple Pay is a digital wallet payment method using an Apple Pay merchant account in coordination with the Adyen payment service. When configured, the Apple Pay button is a selectable payment method as part of online store's order checkout. The Apple Pay button will only be presented as a payment option for supported Apple Pay devices. When users select **Apple Pay** from a supported browser or device, they are directed to complete their payment directly with the Apple Pay service and then are returned to the online storefront for order completion. The **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Apple Pay** connector reference is used in addition to the **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen** to enable Apple Pay and Credit Card payments on a site. Apple Pay can also be configured to use in store with Adyen payment terminals which will utilized the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen (which will handle the Apple Payment device tap through the terminal) with the Commerce point-of-sale.

## Prerequisites
Using Apple Pay with Adyen in Commerce requires a Apple merchant account. Please review the [Adyen documentation on Apple Pay]([Apple Pay Drop-in integration | Adyen Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#set-up-apple-pay)) regarding setting up Apple Pay in your test Customer Area. When ready to go live in production, refer to the [Going live](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#going-live) section in the above Adyen article.

The Apple Pay payment method must also be integrated with your Adyen account. Adyen can assist in both setting up the payment method and ensuring the domains you will use the certificate are assigned for use with the certificate.

Enable the enhanced wallet feature flag in Commerce headquarters. Go to **Workspaces > Feature management** and search for the **Enhanced wallet support and payment improvements** feature. Select the feature, and then click **Enable**. After the feature has been enabled, run the **1110** distribution schedule to make the change available in all channels.



## Map the Apple Pay Payment Method

Apple Pay is a digital wallet payment method. Set up payment mapping for Apple Pay as described in the [Wallet payment support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/wallets) article. 

- In Commerce headquarters, go to **Retail and Commerce > Channel setup > Payment methods > Card types**. 
- Select **New** and add a line for Apple Pay: 
  - ID = ApplePay
  - Electronic payment name = Apple Pay
  - Type = Wallet
  - Issuer = Apple
- Select the **Processor mapping** menu to bring up the Processor payment mapping methods dialogue
- In the **Unmapped Processor Payment Methods** center column, you will see payment methods supported listed against each of the Connectors available (Adyen, PayPal, Apple). 
- Map any of the supported payment methods you wish against both the **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen** (for use at POS) and the **Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Apple Pay** (for online channel) connectors. Select each mapping line to support in the **Unmapped Processor Payment Methods** column and select **Add** to move the selections to the **Mapped Processor Payment Methods** column to map them. 
- Select **OK**, and select **Save** back in the **Card Types** page. 

## Set up the Apple Pay certificate for your site

For each site, you will need to include the obtained domain associated file as described in the [Adyen Apple Pay documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in#going-live). This file can be uploaded into the Media Library for your site using Site Builder.

In the base domain for the sites in Site Builder, use the following steps:

1. Go to your site's Media library, and upload the file that should be served by requests to the URL that you will define. Add a .txt extension to the certificate to allow Site Builder to upload as a file type.
2. Go to **URLs** for your site.
3. Select **New > New URL**.
4. In the **New URL** dialog box, select **Media library asset**.
5. In the **URL path** field, enter the URL path (if not pre-populated by SIte Builder already). From the domain base, enter the required Apple pattern: '<domain>/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.txt' pattern.
6. Select **Next**. The Media library is opened and shows all media assets of the **document** type that have been uploaded.
7. Select the file that should be served for requests to the URL that you defined in step 5. 
8. Select **Create**. 

At this point, the URL that you created is in a draft state. The file that the URL points to won't be returned until you publish the URL. Publish the URL to complete the process.

These steps, along with URL preview prior to validation steps, are utilizing the general [Upload and Serve Static files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/upload-serve-static-files#create-a-site-url-that-returns-a-static-file) instructions for Commerce, provided here as additional reference.
