This article explains how to set up and generate a VAT declaration for legal entities in Estonia.

## Set up sales tax authorities
To generate a VAT declaration in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **Report layout** field, select **Default**. 
Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used for the sales tax codes.
