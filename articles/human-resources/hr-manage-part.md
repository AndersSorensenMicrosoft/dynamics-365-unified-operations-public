# Manage participants in training courses

Course participants are workers who participate in a training course or event. You can only register participants for open courses. The minimum and maximum number of 
participants that can register for a course is defined on the **General** FastTab on the **Courses** page.

There are two ways to manage participants: 

1. Go to **Course** and click the **Participants** tab. This option works well for mass assignment or more than one participant at a time. 

   a. Add participants 
       - Utilize the **Filter by** or **Group by** functionality to easily find participants.  

   b. Assign participants  
      - Once participants have been identified, click **Assign participants**.

To view **Learning** tab in **Manager self service**, go to **Human resources parameters**, select **Direct reports only** or **Extended reports** (includes Direct reports). 

This feature provides managers visibility into learning, this includes all assigned courses, overdue courses, and due soon courses. Manager can assign courses by clicking **Assign courses**. This information can help managers track direct reports courses (extended reports, if chosen) and progress to ensure that workers stay on track and complete assigned courses in a timely manner.
