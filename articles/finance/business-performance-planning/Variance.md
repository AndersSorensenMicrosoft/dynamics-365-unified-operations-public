Variance

# Introduction & Purpose

## Overview

The Variance custom visual plays a pivotal role in Budget Variance Analysis (BVA), enabling users to comprehend and address discrepancies between budgets and actual results. This visual generates sorted bar charts, showcasing the differences between two values, aiding in identifying key drivers behind variances. It empowers users to analyze root causes and refine future planning cycles by sorting variances from largest to smallest.

It aims to bridge the gap between budgeted and actual values, facilitating root cause analysis and driving informed decision-making by presenting variances in a clear, sorted format.
