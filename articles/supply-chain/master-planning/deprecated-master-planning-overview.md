# Deprecated master planning overview

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

As [previously announced](../get-started/removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md#use-of-built-in-supply-chain-management-master-planning-engine-for-distribution-scenarios), the classic or built-in master planning is deprecated. This means that it is no longer supported (unless customers face a blocking issue or a regression in functionality) and it will no longer be invested in (no new features will come on it). 

Planning Optimization is the master planning engine for Dynamics and what replaces the built-in master planning engine.

If you currently use the deprecated master planning engine, you should start planning your migration to Planning Optimization now. It is important to get started right away. We strongly encourage you to complete the migration as soon as Planning Optimization supports the features you require so that you can start taking advantage of the many performance improvements and other new capabilities provided by the new service.

We recommend that you work with a partner to evaluate and plan the migration to Planning Optimization.

Before you switch to Planning Optimization, we strongly recommend that you evaluate the results of the Planning Optimization fit analysis. For more information, see [Planning Optimization fit analysis](planning-optimization/planning-optimization-fit-analysis.md).

## When will classic master planning be removed?

At the moment built-in master planning is not planned to be removed. If it were to be removed in the future, it would be announced at least with one year in advanced in the [removed or deprecated features for Dynamics page](../get-started/removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md).
