# Table edit

This article describes how to use the table edit visual in the Business performance planning application. You must also install Power BI visuals to fully use the planning application. To learn more about installing Power BI visuals, see [Power BI visuals](/power-bi/developer/visuals/).

## Overview

The Table Edit Visual is a powerful feature within D365 Finance business performance planning Power BI that enables direct dimension editing. This functionality offers a multitude of possibilities to modify and manage data directly within your financial planning Power BI reports. It enables:

-   Creating New Scenarios and Versions - allows creation of new forecasting scenarios or versions (e.g., "Forecast," "Version 3").
-   Updating Static Values - allows easy updates to fixed values like 401K match contributions (e.g., 5%).
-   Managing Planning Process Status - enables updates to the status of different planning stages (e.g., "In Review," "Approved").
-   Modifying Drivers in Planning Solutions - Provides the ability to update drivers in driver-based planning solutions (e.g., "Units Sold").
