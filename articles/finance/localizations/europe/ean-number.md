# European article numbering location number

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

A European article numbering (EAN) location number is an electronic address you use when you send or receive an electronic invoice. This number uniquely identifies the buyerâ€™s billing address. EAN location numbers can be used in countries/regions outside Europe and are sometimes referred to as Global Location Numbers (GLN).

## EAN location numbers in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance
Departments, directorates, agencies, and other organizations in Denmark have EAN location numbers that uniquely identify a customer's bill-to address. An EAN location number can be defined as one category and type of a Registration ID. The number is then used for a legal entity, customer, vendor, or any other party that supports registration IDs.

An EAN location number has a fixed length of 13 digits. This number must be processed in its entirety. The following is an example of an EAN number.

**579098765432**1

EAN numbers start with a 3-digit prefix allocated by EAN International. For Denmark, the first three numbers are **579**. The EAN number ends with a check digit that is calculated based on the first 12 digits.
