# 10.0.31 PQU release 3 build information

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

| Update ID | Build Version | Title | Problem Description | Solution |
| --------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------- | -------- |
| 805801 | 7.0.6801.75 | Enabling duplicate record sharing policy fails with underlying query timeout (Revised). | Direct sql queries executed in managed stack receive a default timeout of 30 seconds. When a policy includes customers or vendors, and data size is large, data sharing validation runs a direct SQL command in managed stack. The timeout of 30 seconds is often not enough and policy enablement will fail with &quot;An error occurred when executing update statement&quot;. | The fix applies timeout of 5 minutes to direct sql queries as well.  |
| 805798 | 7.0.6801.76 | Reduce impact of a research call when drilling into a record on a Details form | If a user is on a Details form (that technically contains both the list and details user experiences) and the user drills into a record in the middle of the dataset, if the view that's loaded on the details side of the form contains added fields, the form query will be re-executed to ensure the values for the added fields are available to show in the form. This execution of the query on this transition can be slow.  | The current fix helps to reduce calls for query execution when navigating from list to details within a Details form multiple times while the form is open. When navigating from the list portion of the page to the details portions of the page, if the default view for the details page has at least one added field, the form's query will be executed for the first transition to details. All subsequent navigation to the details page while that same form instance is open won't require a retrigger of the query. So for example, if the default view on the details page of Customers has added fields, the following behavior will occur with this change. If the user is viewing the list of customers and drills into a record, the transition to the details side will result in a re-execution of the query to retrieve data for the added fields. If the user goes back to the list and then drills into another record, there will be no re-execution of the query. This behavior will persist for the user until the form is opened again. Note these changes are only applicable to the &quot;Saved view performance enhancement&quot; feature. |
| 805619 | 10.0.1406.177 | Last Known Good (LKG) - Version 10.0.31 of Finance and Operations apps | This is the final quality update for version 10.0.31 of Finance and Operations apps, which reached end of service.

| 803943 | 7.0.6801.69 | FnO Virtual Entity Odata Actions won't be available if they use Memo types | FnO Virtual Entity Odata Actions won't be available if the action uses any Memo types.  This will surface as the action not being available to invoke from a Dataverse flow when trying to &quot;Perform a bound action&quot; on an FnO virtualized entity.  | This fix addresses the issue with Virtual Entity Odata action support of Memo string fields.  After applying this hotfix, customers will need to refresh their virtual entity metadata in order for the OData actions to virtualize properly. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/enable-virtual-entities#refresh-virtual-entity-metadata  |
| 803854 | 10.0.1406.175 | Norway: User isn't able to run VAT Declaration Excel (NO) -report in batch | When &quot;VAT Declaration Excel (NO)&quot; electronic format is set up in GL parameters &gt; Sales tax, user isn't able to run the report in batch (Tax | Declarations | Sales tax | Report sales tax for settlement period). Work-a-round: run the declaration directly in Electronic Reporting workspace. Expected result: User can run the report in batchAdditional information:If The Sales tax report layout on the tax authority is set to Norway report layout, use can run the report in batch.   | Changes in this hotfix add a possibility to print Electronic Reporting VAT Declaration in batch when sales tax authority report layout is set to &quot;Default&quot; (Modules &gt; Tax &gt; Sales tax &gt; Sales tax authorities) and Electronic Reporting format is defined on the &quot;General ledger parameters&quot; form (Modules &gt; Tax &gt; Setup &gt; Parameters &gt; General ledger parameters &gt; Sales tax &gt; Tax options &gt; Electronic reporting &gt; VAT statement format mapping).  |

| 803400 | 10.0.1406.174 | Payment Advice is sent to the wrong vendor via email | Payment Advice is sent to the wrong vendor via email   | The issue is caused by unexpected retry after the error is caught due to invalid email address. One fix will stop retry and send emails for all payment lines with valid email address. Once there's error indicated for the batch task, customer need to check the invalid email address from message detail and correct the email address on the vendor account. The failed sending of payment advice can be retriggered from payment journal.  |
| 803357 | 7.0.6801.66 | Fixing Export Parameterization issue with multiple filters | When parameterizing queries with multiple filters, the parameters were not getting copied to match the number of parameter spots in the query. This was causing packages to run with fewer parameters than expected, which let to errors.  | This has now been fixed. A full parameter collection should now be built when multiple inner join filters are used in the query.  |
| 802730 | 10.0.1406.173 | When created Purchase order in company which set up intercompany, purchase order isn't created unless sales order is clicked. | The customer created purchase order by manual in the company which set up intercompany. Unless they click sales order in sales company, purchase order isn't created automatically.   | The linked intercompany orders are now being created automatically.  The feature to enable it is called: &quot;Auto-create direct delivery intercompany orders originating from purchase order creation&quot;  |
| 802704 | 10.0.1406.172 | CFDI 4.0 doesn't show Exempt IEPS within the cfdi:Traslados node. | Customer stamped an invoice with a VAT 0% and Exempt IEPS, but they don't see the Exempt IEPS within CFDI in the cfdi:Impuestos &gt;cfdi:Traslados node.  | Modified the code to show Exempt tax section under Comprobante/Impuestos section  |

| 802498 | 10.0.1406.172 | When an electronic reporting destination is added, the electronic reporting job for einvoices in no longer created. | Customer is currently having an issue regarding the einvoice for Peppol in combination with a business document for free text invoices. On a free text invoice, you should be able to print the business document and also generate an electronic reporting job for the XML 'UBL Sales invoice BE' (standard format of Microsoft) which works as expected. But when an electronic reporting destination (in 'electronic reporting destinations') is added only the business document is printed and no electronic job is triggered for the einvoice. When no electronic reporting destination is added (and only the template is chosen on the print management via 'form setup'), an electronic reporting job is created.   | The issue has been solved. Logic introduced by Details for issue 590558 (dynamics.com) has been changed to check setup of applicable &quot;Send&quot; action-dependent ER destination only.  |
| 802242 | 10.0.1406.164 | Sales order history shows an error message | In some cases, customers go to their sales order history, and see an error message: &quot;something went wrong. Please try again later.&quot;  This is a generic message, one of the reasons is that products in a sales order might not be available for the customer anyone.  | This fix solves the problem for any case a product isn't available, in these cases, the sales order history will properly show to the customer.  Impacted Commerce components Use this table to know each impacted component that needs to be updated to solve the issue.

| 802053 | 10.0.1406.172 | Exchange rate 1$ = 100,000 LBP gives an error in POS | When Exchange rate 1$ = 100,000 LBP (more than 99 999,00), the error appears &quot;Something went wrong the exchange rate can't be zero&quot;  | Replaced inaccurate floating point 0-comparison with direct value comparison. Conversion factors are managed in HQ and POS is just used to show user friendly error.  |
| 802048 | 7.0.6801.61 | Executing a collection-bound OData action through F&O virtual entity doesn't work | For a collection-bound OData action (where the isInstanceMethod parameter of the SysODataActionAttribute is set to false), when called through F&amp;O virtual entities, the action can't be executed.  | Updated the F&amp;O virtual entities code that invokes the OData action method so that it doesn't require a RecId, which isn't available when a collection-bound method is being invoked.  This also requires an updated version of the F&amp;O virtual entities solution to be installed in Dataverse.  |
| 801991 | 10.0.1406.171 | Update to Sales order balance that is less than the original Credit card authorization creates a rogue authorization that never gets removed. | System is unable to perform a linked refund in POS due to rogue authorization.   | For cash, check and currency payments, always post the payment by the amount of the payment received during order completion (Prepayments and non-prepayments), and account for overpayments. For credit card, gift card and loyalty prepayments, capture up to the total sales amount. Remove extra credit card authorization for underpayment when order is fully invoiced |
| 801833 | 10.0.1406.165 | Error when disconnecting three-legged intercompany orders using “Disconnect intercompany orders” | When the user tries to disconnect three-legged intercompany orders using the new function “Disconnect intercompany orders” receives the error “Function IntercompanyBreakLinkController.updateThreeLeggedDirectDeliverySalesOrder has been incorrectly called.”  | Three-legged intercompany orders can now be disconnected without errors, as the issue in the tool has been corrected.  |
| 801631 | 10.0.1406.168 | Fixed Assets for Japan - Incorrect amounts of summarized depreciation posted for multiple years | This case was specific to transferring active fixed assets depreciation history from another system with restoration of their multi-year history of depreciation. In case there's posted summarized Fixed Asset depreciation for multiple years and posting date was not end of a fiscal year, plan for future depreciation (profile) is inconsistent.  | Potential workaround for this issue requires posting summarized depreciation for full fiscal years and in last fiscal year period. Transactions should be separated per single fiscal year. Microsoft works on solution to split summarized depreciation per fiscal year instead of posting single transaction for multiple years to avoid issues with calculation of future depreciations.  |
| 801214 | 10.0.1406.165 | Inventory and Production report - conversion to or from InMemory to TempDB | InMemory table type should be changed to TempDB to avoid performance issues for all temporary tables used in Inventory and Production report.  | The table type of the TmpFBInventoryAndProduction_BR table has been changed to TempDB in order to allow the FBInventoryAndProductionDP_BR data provider class to extend the SRSReportDataProviderPreProcessTempDB class which should improve report performance  |

The method causing the error has been implemented to no longer throw an error.  |
| 800933 | 7.0.6801.60 | [LBD] Environments that use a domain user account for the AOS services fail to deploy | Environments that are using an older base topology (older than 10.0.17) that still use a domain user account (AxServiceuser) for running the AOS/bootstrapper processes fail to deploy.  | Fixed credential processing to ensure that credentials are available when retrieved by the installer flows.  |
| 800824 | 10.0.1406.164 | MEXICO_CFDI 4.0 Prepayment_The Receptor's name must inherit the name from the Customer's registered RFC name field. | Customer generates a customer payment journal type prepayment and the stamped CFDI doesn't have the Registered RFC name within the XML.  | modified logic to fetch Customer registered RFC name if filled, into the generated xml.  |
| 800782 | 10.0.1406.164 | Batch task error causing failure of consolidation processing. Deadlock issue. | A consolidation is performed, using a batch. The batch fails with messaging &quot;An error occurred during the consolidation process. All consolidations that match the criteria for this consolidation event have been deleted. You must process the consolidation again.&quot;  | A fix has been made to ensure that the batch will process successfully, without deadlocking on the ledger dimensions.  |
| 800619 | 7.0.6801.58 | Telemetry enhancements to get passthrough users | Currently, we are missing telemetry that could help us figure out whether a scenario is passthrough or not.

Sales tax is reported with wrong purchase document number (the Document number instead of Invoice number in &lt;DowodSprzedazy&gt;) on the sales side of the SAF-T xml files.   | This fix includes a code change that ensures that the relevant fields are populated with the correct invoice id in case of reverse charge transactions.  |
| 800387 | 7.0.6801.57 | SysSetupInstaller batch jobs are in error Status after upgrade to 10.0.32 | SysSetupInstaller batch jobs are failing and moved to error Status after upgrade to 10.0.32. TSQL code responsible for status update in SYSSETUPEXECUTIONHISTORY was merged with a syntax error, which caused all the jobs to error out after main script logic execution on status update.  | The fix corrects syntax error.  |
| 800302 | 10.0.1406.172 | [Commerce] Slow queries on GetCustomerBalance API | A performance issue was introduced in 10.0.31, which would slow down the API Commerce/GetCustomerBalance.  If the system is experiencing slowness in getting customer's balance after upgrading from versions below 10.0.31 to versions above 10.0.31 (included), please take this fix to resolve the performance issues.  | Please upgrade to the target version as specified.  |
| 800154 | 7.0.6801.56 | Enabling duplicate record sharing policy fails with underlying query timeout. | In some cases sql query timeout is unexpectedly set to default .Net 30 seconds for queries issued by policy enabling process. When a policy includes customers or vendors, and data size is big, timeout of 30 seconds is often not enough and policy enablement will fail with &quot;An error occurred when executing update statement&quot;.   | The fix assigns timeout to 5 minutes.  |
| 799761 | 10.0.1406.158 | Unproper duties were added to Sales Manager role | Remove the duty expansion for Sales Manager role  | Remove duties DataManagementApplicationMasterEntitiesMaintain and DataManagementApplicationMasterEntitiesView from Sales Manager role  |
| 799688 | 10.0.1406.164 | When revoking a reversal for a customer/vendor type of transaction, the incorrect transaction could be found due to the same trace number being used. | In revoking of reversal transaction, the last reversal transaction needs to be found by the trace number. This fix enables you to find a correct last transaction by checking the same table type, which enables to avoid finding a wrong transaction with the same trace number.   | In revoking of reversal transaction, the last reversal transaction needs to be found by the trace number. This fix enables you to find a correct last transaction by the same table type, which can avoid finding a wrong transaction with the same trace number. This fix can be enabled by flight enablement.    |
| 799099 | 10.0.1406.157 | SQL truncate error when user open the bank reconciliation worksheet | When user opens the bank reconciliation worksheet, there will be one error like &quot;SQL Datastack error *** String or binary data would be truncated in table 'tempdb.dbo.## ..... , column 'RELATEDPARTYACCOUNT'. Truncated value: '&quot;  | To provide data for the bank reconciliation sheet, there is code to get customer/vendor account from DisplayValue of another table &quot;DimensionAttributeValueCombination&quot;, the length is 500 characters, but the RelatedPartyAccount is 30 characters long. Even if there is data that has longer than 30 characters, the error may still happen. The code only is in set based data operation.  After 10.0.34, there is fix to get data from CustTable or VendTable. Before 10.0.34, customer can solve this error by 2 steps: request to enable flight RemoveLoadReconciliationWorksheetExtensibleFlight After the flight is enabled, please turn on Cash Management parameter &quot;Turn off reconciliation worksheet performance enhancements&quot;.    |
| 798968 | 7.0.6801.54 | DTS_E_INCORRECTCUSTOMPROPERTYTYPE failure in ReinitializeMetadata after DIXF upgrade to PU56 | Import jobs fail with SSIS error code '0xC020201F' (DTS_E_INCORRECTCUSTOMPROPERTYTYPE) in ReinitializeMetadata.  | To avoid this SSIS validation error when running SSIS package generation in a child process, the property TotalCompXmlErrorTable on the entity contract was marked as a data member.  |
| 798753 | 7.0.6801.55 | Filters not working on the Project Quotation page | In Project Quotations, none of the filters are working on the Line items. When you mouse over the column header, the filter symbol (down arrow) appears. If you open that dropdown, a &quot;Column isn't filterable&quot; message appears. | Generically, the issue occurs when a user navigates to a page with an embedded part form. In this situation, the user will then not be able to filter either through the filter pane or the grid if the filtering is performed anywhere outside the part form. The issue was caused by a reordering of DOM elements in the client, which impacted logic for retrieving a correct filtering context for a given form.  This fix ensures the correct filter contexts are applied to the parent form or part form on creation of each filter context.  |
| 798668 | 10.0.1406.157 | Wrong fulfillment quantities display on POS Order Fulfillment when the sales line is partially fulfilled | If a product has different sales unit of measure and inventory unit of measure, and the unit conversion will introduce precision loss, then POS Order Fulfillment will display wrong fulfillment quantities (invoiced, packed, remaining) if the sales line is partially fulfilled.  | Fix invoiced, packed, remaining quantities in POS Order Fulfillment to make sure they are in sales unit of measure without precision loss. Note that for not processed, reserved, and picked quantities in F&amp;O they are only in inventory unit of measure, it might still have precision loss when converting to sales unit of measure, but it will work fine after packed.  |
| 798653 | 10.0.1406.156 | Exclusion of ICMS (ISS, IPI, ICMS-ST, ICMS-DIF if not already) from the PIS/COFINS withholding tax calculation | On JAN.14.2023, MP 1.159/23 was published, which establishes the exclusion of ICMS from the calculation basis of PIS/COFINS withholding tax credits, as of May 1, 2023.  | This is the down-port for the regulatory feature which enables the exclusion of ICMS from the withholding basis of PIS/COFINS.

| 797380 | 7.0.6801.49 | Change Based Alerts Batch Job taking longer time to execute/finish | In case where Cx have substantial number of Change Based Alerts events to be processed, EventJobCUDTask took each event processing averaging 240 ms to compute. This is because EventRule table has several large container fields and large string fields. When queried without a select list, the fact that these fields exist means it takes up to 50-100 ms to initialize and process the transfer buffer, even though the SQL query takes &lt;1 ms on the SQL side.    | This fix optimizes by adding appropriate select lists thus thereby reducing the time to process even in case where there are large number of events to be processed and reduce the AOS/Batch compute and memory load at the same time.  |
| 797108 | 10.0.1406.154 | Checkout fails with Apple Pay payment connector if loyalty or gift card applied | Checkout with Apple Pay payment fails due to the amount sent in the original request doesn't match with the cart amount displayed once a loyalty or gift card payment balance is applied to the order.  | The Apple Pay checkout module has been updated to calculate the full amount of the order, taking into account the currently applied tender lines (from either loyalty or gift card payments) prior to sending request to Apple, to include the final total during the Apple authentication and payment approval. The total presented and approved through the Apple Pay process will align with the intended subtotal after previous payment methods have been applied to the cart total.  |

| 775099 | 10.0.1406.84 | Inconsistent behavior on the new validation fixed asset disposal (sale/scrap) on past values acquisition this year or prior years | For the new validation added in 10.0.29 when posting fixed asset disposal (sale/scrap) to validate the setup for post values for Acquisition this year and Acquisition prior years under the disposal. In case that only one line with the post (Acquisition this year and Acquisition prior years) is defined - meaning for just one book and one group, and then try to post disposal (sales/scrap) for an asset under different FA group (where no setup for that group for Acquisition this year and Acquisition prior years) for the validation pass with no error message.  | Introduced a new parameter &quot;Post disposal transactions in detail&quot; that lets you determine the disposal scrap/sale to consider detailed disposal posting of acquisition to &quot;Acquisition this year&quot; and &quot;Acquisition prior years&quot;. If you set this option to No Then disposal scrap/sale posting process validates the posting profile to have the “Net book value” defined in the posting profile (This is the behavior prior 10.0.29)  If you set this option to Yes Then disposal sale/scrap posting process validates the posting profile to ensure that you have configured the posting profile with all posting types (This is the behavior on 10.0.29 and after) The disposal posting profile has two ways to account the acquisition values during the disposal process, and both directions are utilized by our customers, that is the reason of introducing the above parameter. The first way is the lump sum of all acquisitions that is represented in “Acquisition value” posting type. Acquisition value combines all acquisition transactions in all times in one transaction line and disposal transaction post it to the corresponding account to acquisition value in the posting profile. This could be used if you don't want to break down the acquisitions of this year and prior years. In this case you need to set the Post disposal transactions in detail option in the Fixed assets parameters to No. (This is the behavior prior 10.0.29) The second way; is to differentiate between acquisitions this/prior years that is represented in “Acquisitions this and Acquisition prior years” posting types. Acquisition this year and Acquisition prior years break down the acquisition values in the case of there are different acquisitions posted to the disposed asset this year or prior years. In this case you need to set the Post disposal transactions in detail option in the Fixed assets parameters to Yes, to ensure the system validates against detailed posting types in the posting profile.(This is the behavior on 10.0.29 and after)  It is highly recommended to NOT define both options of posting types of Acquisition value and Acquisition this year or Acquisition prior year in the disposal sale/scrap at the same time to ensure accurate disposal posting to ensure accurate posting. Besides that, enhancements in the general disposal scrap/sale posting validation experience to ensure it considers the granular level of the group/book combination that was originally reported in this bug.      |
