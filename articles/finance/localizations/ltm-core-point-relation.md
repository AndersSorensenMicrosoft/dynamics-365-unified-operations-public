# Sales point relation - Sales documents and remission
You can select which packing slip documents can be used with a sales document when invoicing a product sale by linking sales points that afterward will be assigned to them in the transaction.

## Prerequisites
At least one sale point must be set up before.
A sales invoice document class and a packing slip document class must be created and must have an automatic generated document number mask with a sales point assigned.

## Set up a sales point pair
1. Go to **Organization administration > Setup > LATAM > Sales Point Relation - Sales document and Remission**.
2. Select **New** from the action pane to add a line on the main grid.
3. Select a sales point in the **Sales document sales point** field.
4. Select a sales point in the **Remission sales point** field.
5. Select **Save** from the action pane.
