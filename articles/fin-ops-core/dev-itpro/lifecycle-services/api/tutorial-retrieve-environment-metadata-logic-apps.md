# Tutorial: Retrieve environment metadata via Logic Apps

This tutorial is aimed at enabling you to take advantage of the Lifecycle Services API to periodically scan your environments and capture the metadata details. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

1.	Create a Power Automate or Logic Apps workflow (Azure) that authenticates with Lifecycle Services API. 
2.	Call the Environment Metadata endpoint to retrieve the details about a given environment. 

In this example scenario, a customer needs to know the database backup location and if a backup was taken daily for their audit and compliance needs. This can be retrieved using the follwoing steps.

## Step 1: Create the workflow and set up the variables
This tutorial uses a Logic Apps workflow.  A Power Automate flow is also acceptable, and any other orchestration engine that your company prefers to use for automation. All the calls to retrieve the data use RESTful APIs so any tooling that supports REST works with this tutorial.

Visit the Azure portal, and then create a new logic app and give it a name:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Create a logic app.](media/tutorial-create-logic-app.png "Create a logic app (Azure)")

After that finishes provisioning, edit the workflow using the Designer and set up a Recurrence trigger to run on schedule of your choosing:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Set up a Recurrence trigger.](media/capacity2.png "Set up a Recurrence trigger")

For the remainder of this tutorial, you need a Project ID and an environment ID to complete the subsequent steps:

- **Environment Id**: The ID of the environment to which you would install the package. This ID is found on the environment details page in Lifecycle Service.
- **Project ID**: The ID of the project where the environment resides. This ID is found in the URL of the environment details page.

Next, authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID and retrieve a token for calling the Lifecycle Services API. If you havenâ€™t completed your Entra ID setup, see [Authentication (preview)](../../database/api/dbmovement-api-authentication.md).

In this tutorial, we're using a user credential with password to obtain a token. The following is an example call to Entra ID.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Authenticate with Entra ID and retrieve a token for calling the Lifecycle Services API.](media/tutorial-lcs-token.png "Authenticate with Entra ID and retrieve a token for calling the Lifecycle Services API")

We then parse the Entra ID token response into a typed object using this JSON schema in the 'Parse JSON' action:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "access_token": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "expires_in": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "ext_expires_in": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "token_type": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "type": "object"
}
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Parse the Entra ID token response into a strongly typed object.](media/capacity5.png "Parse the Entra ID token response into a strongly typed object")

## Step 2: Retrieve the environment details

In this section, we retrieve the backup details. Be sure to have your **environment Id** and **project ID** available.

### Environment Metadata endpoint

Now we make our first call to the Lifecycle Services API. Use the [Fetch environment metadata](./v1/reference-environment-metadata.md) to retrieve all of the available metadata properties. Be sure that you use a bearer token from a user who has access to see this environment in the Lifecycle Services project in question.

```http
GET https://lcsapi.lcs.dynamics.com/environmentinfo/v1/detail/project/{projectId}/?environmentId={environmentId}
```

And we receive responses similar to the following example.

```json
{
    "ResultPageCurrent": 1,
    "ResultHasMorePages": true,
    "Data": [
        {

### Applications of this data
For customers who need to maintain logs or records of the environment details, they might use this approach to capture the state of the environment via the API as shown in earlier steps.  This can then be saved in the logs of the tool itself like Logic Apps using their run history, or it can be saved as a file in to blob storage or on-premises for long term retention.
