If you run an e-commerce website, you know the importance of having engaging and persuasive product enrichment and marketing content that can attract and convert your customers. But creating such content can be time-consuming and challenging, especially if you have a large product catalog and a diverse audience. To assist with content creation, Microsoft introduced Copilot in site builder, a new AI-powered tool that helps you generate high-quality content with ease and efficiency.

Copilot in site builder works seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder to help you quickly creating product enrichment and marketing content that is tailored to your target audience and brand tone. Site builder offers a range of templates, features, and tools to help you customize your website to meet your needs and preferences. With Copilot in site builder, you can generate persuasive, compelling, and engaging product enrichment and marketing content for your e-commerce websites quickly and efficiently. 

You can use Copilot in site builder to initiate the creative process by first selecting a tone that aligns to your brand, for example "adventurous," "luxurious," or "bold." Next you can select an audience from choices managed by you, for example "sports enthusiast" or "college graduate." Copilot then uses these prompts to craft compelling and engaging content based on existing product information such as name, description, attributes, and price. 

Copilot in site builder offers the following capabilities:

- **Initiate the creative process** - Copilot creates content based on basic product information such as name, description, attributes, and dimensions. You can then use the generated content to spark further ideas.
- **Optimize for search engines** - Optimize your product marketing content for search engines to rank your e-commerce site rank higher in internet search results and help drive up sales.
- **Choose the messaging tone** - You can select the voice that best fits your brand and audience, and specify a unique tone for each product. The tone of message for a product can be adventurous, casual, luxurious, formal, informational, educational, and more.
- **Create custom messages for specific buyers** - Select the intended audience to create custom messages for specific buyers such as new parents, graduates, senior citizens, and health care workers.
- **Amplify with key highlights** - Augment your content with key highlights specific to a product using natural language, and generate engaging text snippets that help amplify key highlights for your product.
- **Make basic modifications** - Easily make basic text modifications using an inline rich text editor or by providing key prompts to format text using natural language.
