# Known issues in the preview release

The Asset Management mobile app is currently in public preview and therefore has a couple of known limitations that we expect to correct in the final release.

### Too much vertical whitespace on the job details page on iOS devices

On iOS devices, the first time you open job details from the jobs list page, some of the fields will show too much vertical white space. This issue only occurs the first time you open the details page. To mitigate the issue, return to the jobs list and then reopen the details. This limitation only applies to iOS devices.

### Limited file-type support for attachments

The current release provides only limited support for file attachments on the job details page. We plan to add support for more file types in the final release.

Supported attachment types:

- URL (link)
- PNG (image)

Unsupported attachment types:

- Simple note
- All other file types
