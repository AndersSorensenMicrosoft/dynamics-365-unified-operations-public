# Record archiving overview

Finance and operations applications generate business data at a regular cadence over time.Â  On average, medium to upper-mid market businesses accumulate over a terabyte of data in less than five years. The data growth is directly proportional to the age of the business and the number of transactions made year over year.

## How the solution works

The archive solution lets you archive transactional data to *history tables* within the transactional SQL database. These history tables have *limited indexing*, which results in a significant reduction in the storage space used. From a user perspective, data moves from the live tables to the history tables as a single process, but the system actually moves the data using several smaller database transactions to avoid processing delays in other areas of the app. The following steps happen as a single process from the user perspective:

1. The system copies the data range specified from the live tables to the history tables.
1. The system removes the data range specified from the live tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Data in the history tables can't be edited.

## The Archive workspace

Use the **Archive** workspace to create and work with your archives. It lets you do the following actions:

- Set up and schedule archive jobs
- Browse archives
- Monitor the progress of running archive jobs
- Cancel scheduled archive jobs
- Review the archive history and logs
- Reverse archives (for example, if you need to edit the data of an archived record)

## Next steps

- Install the required add-in and enable the features you need as described in [Set up record archiving](archive-setup.md)
- [Extend the archive solution to support custom tables and fields](archive-customizations.md)
- [Archive general ledger data](archive-general-ledger.md)
- [Archive sales orders](archive-sales-orders.md)
