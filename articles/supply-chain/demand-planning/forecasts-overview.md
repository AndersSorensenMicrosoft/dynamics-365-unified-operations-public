# Forecasts overview

&lt;intro&gt;

The Demand planning app lets you build a collection of *forecast profiles*, each of which takes an existing time series as input, prepares the data, and then runs any of several available forecasting algorithms to create a new times series that predicts demand over a coming period.

Typically, a manager or system administrator will create the initial collection required profiles and, after that, forecasters and other users will be able to run the profiles to generate new calculated time series as needed.
