This article explains how to set up the company logo that Supply Chain Management will pass to the Warehouse Management mobile app.

## Upload the company logo image in Supply Chain Management
In Supply Chain Management, there are two places where you can upload an image for the company logo, both in **Organization Administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**:
1.	On the **Dashboard image** tab, select *Logo* on the **Dashboard company image type field**, and upload your image
2.	Or, upload the image on the **Report company logo image tab**

## How the image is selected
If an image has been uploaded in both the above places, then the image uploaded on the **Dashboard image** tab will always be the one that is used by the Warehouse Management mobile app, even if *Logo* is not the currently selected value of the **Dashboard company image type** field, as long as there is an image uploaded under that value.
