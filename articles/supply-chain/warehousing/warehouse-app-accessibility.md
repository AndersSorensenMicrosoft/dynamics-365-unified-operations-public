# Accessibility

## Font and button scale 
This feature ensures the app remains user-friendly and accessible to many users, including those with visual impairments.

### Font Scaling
The app supports font scaling from 50% to 400%, allowing users to adjust the text size to their preference. This flexibility ensures that users can comfortably read and interact with the app's content, regardless of their visual acuity.

It's important to note that the font size in the Warehouse Management mobile app does not reflect the operating system's font settings. This independence allows users to set font sizes in the app separately from their device's settings, allowing for a more personalized experience.

### Button Scaling
In addition to font scaling, the Warehouse Management mobile app supports button scaling from 50% to 200%. This feature enables users to adjust the size of buttons and other interactive elements within the app, making it easier to tap and interact with its functionality.

### High-contrast White
This high-contrast theme features a white background with bold, black text and high-contrast colors for interactive elements. It is designed to enhance readability for users with visual impairments or those who require a higher level of contrast to read a text and interact with the app comfortably.

#### High-contrast Black
Similar to the high-contrast white theme, the high-contrast black theme offers a black background, white text, and high-contrast colors for interactive elements. This theme is also designed to improve readability and accessibility for users with visual impairments or those who require a higher level of contrast.

### Bottom-right

## Screen Readers
The Warehouse Management mobile app is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users with disabilities can interact with the app effectively. The app is accessible on three major platforms: Android, iOS, and Windows. To provide a seamless experience for users with visual impairments, WMA supports and is limited to the following screen readers on each platform:
