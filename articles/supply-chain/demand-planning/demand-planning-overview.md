# Demand planning overview

Inaccurate forecasts and demand plans can lead to lost revenue and inefficiency in the supply chain, but providing forecasts infused with intelligence will lead to more accurate and effective demand plans. Direct impact can be measured in improved revenue and fewer stockouts. Operating expenses are reduced in supply chains that require fewer fire drills.

The Demand planning app for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is Microsoft's next-generation collaborative demand-planning solution, powered by best-in-class forecasting algorithms and models, and offering immersive user experiences, intelligent reports, and analytics. It empowers organizations to build an agile, resilient, and sustainable demand-planning practice fueled by intelligence and collaboration. It offers:

- **A no-code approach** to demand modelling and planning configuration. Flexible building blocks enable the vast majority (over 85%) of demand planners who are not data scientists to do what-if planning and analyze, optimize, and compare scenarios in minutes.

- **Seamless, on-the-fly aggregation and disaggregation**, which enable planners to edit forecasts on a corporate or product-group level, then zoom in and instantly see the impact on the regional and stock keeping unit (SKU) level.

- **Improved forecast accuracy** with automatic artificial intelligence (AI) parameter tuning, which helps ensure accurate forecasting and preprocessing. External signals enable superior forecast accuracy by considering promotions or stockouts.

- **Disruption readiness** with interactive and fast what-if analysis. Version history allows tracking, evaluating forecast changes, and using the lessons learned to improve the decision-making process.

- **Effective collaboration throughout the planning cycle** made possible by Microsoft Teams in-context communication, in-product commenting, and restorable versions of forecast values throughout the planning process.

- **Increased agility through integrated planning and execution flow** with native integration to Supply Chain Management, customizable worksheets, and exception-based planning.

## The demand planning process

Demand planning provides functionality for the complete demand planning process, which proceeds as follows:

:::image type="content" source="media/demand-planning-process.png" alt-text="The demand planning process":::

1. **Import data** – Import your historical data, products, sites, warehouses, prices etc to the Demand Planning app.

1. **Create transformation** – Transform imported data from tables into time series by identifying data columns, choosing time buckets, and shifting dates. For example, you can shift historical data from last year to next year to be used as a base for the forecast, apply multiplications, or combine the data from different systems.

1. **Create forecasts** – Use different forecasting models to create a forecast, including your own Azure Machine Learning model if you'd like, or let AI find out for you which forecast model works best.

1. **Review and adjust forecast** – Work on the forecast, adjust values, and get different perspectives into how pricing, weather, promotional events, and other factors could affect the forecast. Collaborate to reach the most accurate forecast.

1. **Export data** – Once your forecast is done, you can export it to any external system that can consume forecasts.

## Licensing

The Demand planning application is currently in public preview and is free to use for purposes of testing and evaluation. When the application becomes generally available, it will be licensed separately and there will be an added cost to use it in a production environment.
