# Supported data source types for ER components

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use the [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) framework to design an ER solution that you can run in the Dynamics 365 Finance application to [generate](er-overview-components.md#format-components-for-outgoing-electronic-documents) an outbound business document or to [parse](er-overview-components.md#format-components-for-incoming-electronic-documents) an inbound business document. To fill in a generated document with application data or to update the application database using data from an inbound business document, specify in your ER solution how this data is fetched from the appropriate data storage, transformed in accordance to the layout of a processed document, and formatted based on specific requirements. To specify data fetching, transformation, and formatting, use various types of ER data sources. The following ER data source types are currently supported for Finance:

-   [Data model](#data-model-group)
    -   [Data model](#data-model)
    -   [Enumeration](#model-enumeration)
    -   [Enumeration user input parameter](#model-enumeration-user-input-parameter)
    -   [Lookup](#model-enumeration-lookup)
-   [Dynamics 365 application (Finance)](#dynamics-365-finance-group)
    -   [Class](#class)
    -   [Enumeration](#enumeration)
    -   [Lookup](#lookup)
    -   [Number sequence](#number-sequence)
    -   [Object](#object)
    -   [Table](#table)
    -   [Table records](#table-records)
-   [Format](#format-group)
    -   [Export format](#export-format)
    -   [Import format](#import-format)
-   [Format enumeration](#format-enumeration-group)
    -   [Enumeration](#format-enumeration)
    -   [Enumeration user input parameter](#format-enumeration-user-input-parameter)
    -   [Lookup](#format-enumeration-lookup)
-   [Functions](#functions-group)
    -   [Barcode](#barcode)
    -   [Calculated field](#calculated-field)
    -   [Data collection](#data-collection)
    -   [Financial dimensions details](#financial-dimensions-details)
    -   [Group by](#group-by)
    -   [Inventory dimensions details](#inventory-dimensions-details)
    -   [Join](#join)
    -   [Table metadata](#table-metadata)
-   [General](#general-group)
    -   [Empty container](#empty-container)
    -   [Endless list](#endless-list)
    -   [User input parameter](#user-input-parameter)

This article provides a summary of the ER data source types.

## Add a new data source

You can configure ER data sources in the ER [model mapping](er-overview-components.md#model-mapping-component) and ER [format](er-overview-components.md#format-component) components of your ER solution for data fetching, transformation, and formatting. Then you can bind configured data sources with data consumers. Data consumers include a [data model](er-overview-components.md#data-model-component) of the designed ER model mapping or format elements of the designed ER format.

Select a more convenient grouping mode to quickly discover a data source that you want to review or modify.

- When the **Group view** toggle of the **Model mapping designer** or **Format designer** page is on, the configured data sources are grouped by the data source type.

    ![Toggle the Group view option on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-toggle-group-view2.png)

- When this toggle is off, the added data sources are sorted in alphabetic order.
    
    ![Toggle the Group view option off the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-toggle-group-view1.png)

You can filter the list of configured data sources by selecting the more appropriate view mode on the **Model mapping designer** or **Format designer** page:

- Select **Show all** to observe all configured data sources.
- Select **Show mapped only** to list only the data sources that are explicitly used in configured bindings.
- Select **Show not-mapped only** to list only the data sources that aren't used in configured bindings.

    ![Select the Show mapped only option on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-select-mapped-only-view.png)

### Model mapping designer

When you want to add a new data source, select the desired data source type in the left **Data Source Types** pane of the **Model mapping designer** page that offers the tree of supported ER data sources.

The center **Data sources** pane of this page presents data sources that have already been added to the current model mapping. Select **Add root** and **Add** to initiate a new data source entry.

- To add a new top level data source, select **Add root**.
- To add a new child data source, select an existing data source in the **Data sources** pane as the parent node for the adding data source, and then select **Add**.

The following illustration shows the entry of a new child data source of the ***Enumeration*** type.

![Entry of a new child data source on the Model mapping designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-new-child-ds-entry.gif)

> [!TIP]
> Use the Data source types picker to hide the **Data source types** pane and free additional space to enlarge the **Data sources** and **Data model** panes.

![Hide the DATA SOURCE TYPES pane on the Model mapping designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-hide-ds-pane.gif)

### Format designer

The **Mapping** tab of the **Format designer** page presents data sources that have been already added to the current format.

- To add a new top level data source, select **Add root**. Then, in the **Add data source** dialog box, select the desired data source type.
- To add a new child data source, select an existing data source on the **Mapping** tab as the parent node for the adding data source, and select **Add**. Then, in the **Add data source** dialog box, select the desired data source type.

The following illustration shows the entry of a new top level data source of the ***Data model > Enumeration*** type.

![Entry of a new top level data source on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-new-root-ds-entry.gif)

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that the following data source types are only offered for entry when the **Show details** toggle of the **Format designer** page is on:
> 
>   - Class
>   - Object
>   - Table
>   - Table records

## Common properties of ER data sources

The properties described in this section can be specified for any type of data source.

### Name property

As data source names must be unique in the ER component, the **Name** property is mandatory. Use this property to uniquely identify the added data source in the configured ER component.

### Label property

The **Label** property is optional. Use this property to specify the alternative data source name. Select **Translate** to specify language dependent text for the label of the editable data source. When the label is [translated](er-design-multilingual-reports.md#entry), the label is presented on the **Model mapping designer** or **Format designer** page in the language that is preferred by the current user.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Show name first** toggle of the **Model mapping designer** or **Format designer** page to sort data sources by name or label.

When this property is specified for a data source that's used to let you enter information in a data entry field, the configured label is used as the prompt text of that data entry field. When this property is translated, the prompt text of that data entry field is presented in your preferred language, or the preferred language of the current user.

### Help property

The **Help** property is optional. Use this property to specify the data source description. You can use the **Translate** option to specify language dependent text for the description of the editable data source. When the description is translated, the description is presented on the bottom of the **Model mapping designer** or **Format designer** page in the preferred language.

The following illustration shows the entry of data source properties on the **Format designer** page.

![Entry of data source properties on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-common-properties-entry.gif)

## <a name="data-model-group"></a>Data model group

You can configure data sources of different types that represent a data model that has been selected as a base of the editable ER model mapping or ER format component. This section provides a summary of properties that are common for all types of ER data sources that belong to the **Data model** group.

### Model property

The mandatory **Model** property refers to the ER data model component that specifies the structure of this data source.

### Definition property

The optional **Definition** property points to a single root element of the selected ER data model component to specify what part of the referred ER data model is used in this data source.

> [!TIP]
> The **Definition** property can be blank when the default root definition has been specified in the referred data model.

### Version property

The optional **Version** property is used to specify the revision of the data model component of this data source. Expand the **Versions** FastTab of the **Configurations** page for the appropriate data model configurations to review the list of data model revisions that are available in the current Finance instance.

> [!TIP]
> Keep this property blank to use a data model component from the configuration [version](er-overview-components.md#component-versioning) in the **Draft** status. This allows you to simultaneously edit you ER model mapping or ER format along with its base data model.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This property must be specified when the status of the editable configuration is changed from **Draft** to **Completed**. If you change the structure of the draft data model and use these changes in the edited ER model mapping or ER format, change the status of the edited base data model configuration version from **Draft** to **Completed** before you do the same change for the edited configuration version of the ER model mapping or ER format. Otherwise, the [Path not found](er-components-inspections.md#i3) exception will be thrown when you try to complete the draft version of the edited ER model mapping or ER format configuration.

### <a name="data-model"></a>Data model

The **Data model** data source represents the ER data model component that is filled in by actual data at runtime when a data consumer request occurs.

> [!TIP]
> This data source is automatically added for any ER format component that's created to generate an outbound document.

The following illustration shows the data source properties of the ***Data model*** type in the **Data source properties** dialog box.

![Entry of data source properties on the Data source properties dialog.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-data-model-properties.png)

### <a name="model-enumeration"></a>Model enumeration

The **Data model enumeration** data source represents the enumeration of the base data model. Usually, this data source is required when you configure an ER [expression](er-formula-language.md) to compare value of a data model field with a particular enumeration value.

The mandatory **Model enumeration** property points to a data model enumeration of the selected ER data model component to specify what values of the referred ER data model enumeration are used in this data source.

The following illustration shows the data source properties of the ***Model enumeration*** type in the **Data source properties** dialog box.

![Entry of data source properties on the Data source properties dialog.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-data-model-enum-properties.png)

### <a name="model-enumeration-user-input-parameter"></a>Model enumeration user input parameter

The **Model enumeration user input parameter** data source represents the enumeration of the base data model. Usually, this data source is required when you want the value of the referred enumeration specified in the related data entry field in the dialog box at runtime, before the ER format is executed.

The mandatory **Model enumeration** property of **Model enumeration user input parameter** data source points to a data model enumeration of the selected ER data model component to specify what values of the referred ER data model enumeration are returned by this data source.

The **Allow multiple selection** property identifies whether you can specify a single value or multiple values of the referred enumeration.

The **Read only** property allows you to configure an ER expression to specify whether the appropriate data entry field in the dialog box at runtime is editable.

The **Default value** property allows you to configure an ER expression to specify the default value for the appropriate data entry field in the dialog box at runtime.

The **Always reset to default value** property identifies whether the value that is returned by the **Default value** ER expression should always be used as the default value, regardless of the previously used value.

Use the **Edit visibility** function to configure an ER expression that will specify at runtime whether the appropriate data entry field should be shown in the dialog box at runtime:

-   When this expression is configured and return *[False](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#boolean)* at runtime, the appropriate data entry field in the dialog box will be hidden.
-   Otherwise, the appropriate data entry field will be visible in the dialog box at runtime.

To learn more, review the [Use USER INPUT PARAMETER data sources to specify parameters for a report](er-user-input-parameter-data-sources.md) article.

### <a name="model-enumeration-lookup"></a>Model enumeration lookup

You can use the **Model enumeration lookup** data source to configure an ER data source of the *Lookup* type to return values of an ER data model enumeration. 

> [!NOTE]
> The **Model enumeration lookup** data source can be only configured for an ER format component.

Configure a data source of the ***Model enumeration lookup*** type for data filtering in an ER format so that it's based on a set of abstract rules. You can then specify real rules beyond the ER components designers by using the user interface that is automatically generated based on the settings of the **Lookup** data source of the corresponding ER format and the current legal entity data. Eventually, the specified rules will be accessed by the ER format's **Lookup** data source when this ER format is executed.

The mandatory **Model enumeration** property of the **Model enumeration lookup** data source points to a data model enumeration of the base ER data model component to specify what values of the referred ER data model enumeration are returned by this data source.

The **Cross-company** property identifies whether you plan to use the configured data source to evaluate at runtime data of multiple companies.

The **Extended** property reveals additional methods to access values of the configured data source.

To learn more, review the [Configure Lookup data sources to use ER application-specific parameters](er-lookup-data-sources.md) article.

## <a name="format-enumeration-group"></a>Format enumeration group

You can configure data sources of different types that represent the editable format component and return values of an enumeration of this format. This section provides a summary of properties that are common for all types of ER data sources that belongs to the **Format enumeration** group.

> [!NOTE]
> Data sources of the **Format enumeration** group can be only configured for an ER format component.

The mandatory **Enumeration** property refers to an ER format enumeration the value of which the configured data source returns.

### <a name="format-enumeration"></a>Format enumeration

The **Enumeration** data source represents the enumeration of the editable format. The following illustration shows a format enumeration that has been configured for the editable format component.

![The configured format enumeration on the Format enumerations page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-configure-format-enum.gif)

-   Select **Add** of the **Format enumeration** tab to add a new format enumeration.
-   Select **Add** of the **Format enumeration values** tab to add a new value of the selected format enumeration.

> [!TIP]
> The **Label** and **Help** properties of format enumerations and format enumeration values are translatable.

Usually, this data source is required when you configure an ER expression to compare a particular format enumeration value with a value of the relevant enumeration that another data source returns.

The following illustration shows properties of a data source of the ***Format enumeration*** type on the **Data source properties** dialog.

![Entry of a data source properties on the Data source properties dialog.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-format-enum-properties.png)

### <a name="format-enumeration-user-input-parameter"></a>Format enumeration user input parameter

The **Format enumeration user input parameter** data source represents the enumeration of the editable format. Usually, this data source is required when you want user to specify a value of the referred enumeration in the related data entry field in the dialog box at runtime, before execution of an ER format begins.

The mandatory **Format enumeration** property of **Format enumeration user input parameter** data source points to an enumeration of the editable format to specify what values of the referred format enumeration are returned by this data source.

![Entry of a data source properties on the Data source properties dialog.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-format-enum-uip-properties.png)

The **Allow multiple selection**, **Read only**, **Default value**, and **Always reset to default value** properties are set as described above for the [Model enumeration user input parameter](#model-enumeration-user-input-parameter) data source type.

> [!TIP]
> When you leave the **Label** or **Help** property blank for a data source of the ***Format enumeration user input parameter*** type, the appropriate property of the referred format enumeration will be used if it has been configured. 

The following illustration shows an ER expression that is configured to enable an ER format element depending on the result of comparison of values of data sources of the ***Format enumeration user input parameter*** and ***Format enumeration*** types.

![Configure an ER expression on the Format designer page to fill in an ER format element.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-format-enum-expression.png)

### <a name="format-enumeration-lookup"></a>Format enumeration lookup

You can use the **Format enumeration lookup** data source to configure an ER data source of the ***Lookup*** type to return values of an ER format enumeration. 

Configure a data source of the ***Format enumeration lookup*** type for data filtering in an ER format so that it's based on a set of abstract rules. You can then specify real rules beyond the ER components designers by using the user interface that is automatically generated based on the settings of the **Lookup** data source of the corresponding ER format and the current legal entity data. Eventually, the specified rules will be accessed by the ER format's **Lookup** data source when this ER format is executed.

The mandatory **Format enumeration** property of the **Format enumeration lookup** data source points to a format enumeration of the editable format to specify what values of the referred format enumeration are returned by this data source.

The **Cross-company** and **Extended** properties are set as described above for the [Model enumeration lookup](#model-enumeration-lookup) data source type.

## <a name="format-group"></a>Format group

### <a name="export-format"></a>Export format

You can use the **Export format** data source to run another ER format in scope of the editable format execution. So, the results of execution of the nested ER format can be used as a data source for execution of the editable ER format.

Use the mandatory **Format** property to specify an ER format that must be executed in scope of the editable format execution.

### <a name="import-format"></a>Import format

You can use the **Import format** data source to parse an inbound business document. So, the results of an inbound document parsing can be used in the format mapping to fill a data model.

Use the mandatory **Format** property to specify an ER format that must be used for inbound document parsing.

The following illustration shows the ER format that is configured to parse an inbound document in XML format.

![The format structure on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-import-format-structure.png)

The following illustration shows the model mapping that contains a data source of the ***Import format*** type using to expose data of the parsed inbound document and use this data to fill a data model.

![The data source of the Import format type on the Model mapping designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-import-format-mapping.gif)

To learn more, review the [Parse incoming documents](er-parse-incoming-documents.md) article.

## <a name="dynamics-365-finance-group"></a>Dynamics 365 Finance group

### <a name="class"></a>Class

You can use the **[Class](er-formula-supported-data-types-composite.md#class)** data source to call from your ER solution a static method of a public class. Values of arguments for calling classes can be dynamically defined at runtime. To invoke a class, configure a data source of the ***Calculated field*** type with an expression that refers the desired class of application source code. To learn more, complete the steps of the procedure in the [Design ER expressions to call application class methods](./tasks/design-expressions-app-class-er.md) article.

You can add a data source of the ***Class*** type in the editable **Model mapping** component. Should you identify the editable model mapping as the preferrable one for execution, set the **Integration point** option of this data source of the ***Class*** type to **Yes**. To learn more about this option, review the [API to run a format mapping for the generation of outbound documents](er-apis-app10-0-11.md#api-to-run-a-format-mapping-for-the-generation-of-outbound-documents) section.

### <a name="object"></a>Object

You can use the **[Object](er-formula-supported-data-types-composite.md#object)** data source to call from your ER solution a public method of a class instance. Values of arguments for calling classes can be dynamically defined at runtime. To invoke a class, configure a data source of the ***Calculated field*** type with an expression that refers the desired class of application source code.

You can add a data source of the ***Object*** type in the editable **Model mapping** component. Should you identify the editable model mapping as the preferrable one for execution at runtime, set the **Integration point** option of this data source of the ***Object*** type to **Yes**.

### <a name="enumeration"></a>Enumeration

The **Enumeration** data source represents the application enumeration. The following illustration shows a format enumeration that has been configured for the editable format component. Usually, this data source is required when you configure an ER expression to compare a particular application enumeration value with a value of the relevant enumeration that another data source returns.

Use the mandatory **Enumeration** property to specify an application enumeration.

The following illustration shows properties of a data source of the ***Application enumeration*** type on the **Data source properties** dialog.

![Entry of data source properties on the Data source properties dialog.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-app-enum-properties.png)

### <a name="lookup"></a>Lookup

You can use the **Application enumeration lookup** data source to configure an ER data source of the ***Lookup*** type to return values of an application enumeration. 

Configure a data source of the ***Application enumeration lookup*** type for data filtering in an ER format so that it's based on a set of abstract rules. You can then specify real rules beyond the ER components designers by using the user interface that is automatically generated based on the settings of the **Lookup** data source of the corresponding ER format and the current legal entity data. Eventually, the specified rules will be accessed by the ER format's **Lookup** data source when this ER format is executed.

The mandatory **Operations data type name (EDT, enum)** property of the **Application enumeration lookup** data source points either to an application enumeration or to an application [extended data type (EDT)](../extensibility/extensible-edts.md) to specify what values are returned by this data source.

The **Cross-company** and **Extended** properties are set as described above for the [Model enumeration lookup](#model-enumeration-lookup) data source type.

### <a name="number-sequence"></a>Number sequence

You can use the **Number sequence** data source to return a value of the referred number sequence of the current application instance. So, whenever a data consumer calls this data source, the referred number sequence is incremented and the received value is [returned](#num-sequence-data-source-sample).

The mandatory **Number sequence code** property must be specified to identify the required number sequence.

In addition to **Number sequence** data sources, you can use the ER built-in [NUMSEQVALUE](er-functions-other-numseqvalue.md) function.

### <a name="table"></a>Table

You can use the **Table** data source to call static methods of an application table, entity, or view in the same manner as you call static methods of an application class that is described above.

The mandatory **Table** property must be specified to identify the required table, entity, or view.

### <a name="table-records"></a>Table records

You can use the **Table records** data source to fetch records of an application table, entity, or view.

The mandatory **Table** property must be specified to identify the required table, entity, or view.

Specify the **Cross-company** property that is important when you refer in the **Table** property a table, entity, or view that keeps records as company specific:

-   Set this property to **No** to fetch the only records of the company in scope of which an ER solution is executed.
-   Set this property to **Yes** to fetch records of all companies of the current application instance.

Set the **Ask for query** option to **Yes** to enable the system query dialog box at runtime allowing user to filter data for the configured data source. To learn more, review the [Cross-company data sources in Electronic reporting (ER)](er-cross-company-data-sources.md) article.

Should you identify the editable model mapping as the preferrable one for execution, set the **Integration point** option to **Yes**.

Use the **Select fields** function to limit the list of fields the values of which will be fetched at runtime. To learn more, review the [Improve performance of ER solutions by reducing the number of table fields that are fetched at runtime](er-reduce-fetched-fields-number.md) article.

Use the **Refill table** function whenever you added or updated Application Object Tree (AOT) artifacts. This function is similar to the [Rebuild table references](electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md#optional-setup-for-er) one.

## <a name="general-group"></a>General group

### <a name="empty-container"></a>Empty container

You can use the **Empty container** data source as the container for other data sources. So, you can use it to organize your data sources. You can make groups of data sources of different types, specific purposes, etc.

In addition, you can use an **Empty container** data source as the mockup of the desired record. So, using the [LIST](er-functions-list-list.md#example) function, you can limit the list of fields of the final list of records.

### <a name="endless-list"></a>Endless list

You can configure an ER format to split a generated XML output in multiple files whenever specific limits are exceeded. So, you can use the **Endless list** data source to uniquely name those outbound files.

The following illustration shows the sample ER format that is configured to generate a zipped XML output that must be split in multiple files.

![The structure of the sample ER format on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-endless-list-format.png)

The following illustrations show bindings of the sample ER format:

-   The `Item` format element is bound to the `ListofItems` data source that returns 3 records. The **Maximal number of elements per file** property of this format element is configured to split a generated output in multiple XML files each of which must contain the only one `Item` XML node.

    ![The bindings of the sample ER format on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-endless-list-bindings1.png)

-   The **File parameters list** property of the **File** format element refers to the `Parms` data source of the ***Endless list*** type to guarantee that whenever the output split is happening, this data source is invoked. As the `Parms` data source contains the nested `NumSequence` <a name="num-sequence-data-source-sample">data source</a> of the ***[Number sequence](#number-sequence)*** type, the referred in `NumSequence` application number sequence is iterated for each split as well. Therefore, the configured in the **File name** property of the **File** component `Parms.NumSequence` ER expression generates a unique name for each output file based on the current value of the referred number sequence.

    ![The bindings of the sample ER format on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-endless-list-bindings2.png)

The following illustration shows the result of execution of the described above sample ER format. It represents a zipped file that contains an XML output that has been split in 3 uniquely named XML files.

![The result of execution of the sample ER format on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-endless-list-output.png)

To learn more, review the [Split generated XML files based on file size and content quantity](er-split-files.md) article.

### <a name="user-input-parameter"></a>User input parameter

You can use a data source of the ***User input parameter*** type to let user specify a value of the referred application enumeration or application EDT in the related data entry field in the dialog box at runtime, before execution of an ER format begins.

The mandatory **Operations data type name (EDT, enum)** property of the **User input parameter** data source points either to an application enumeration or to an application EDT to specify what values are returned by this data source.

The **Allow multiple selection**, **Read only**, **Default value**, and **Always reset to default value** properties are set as described above for the [Model enumeration user input parameter](#model-enumeration-user-input-parameter) data source type.

Use the **Edit visibility** function as described above for the [Model enumeration user input parameter](#model-enumeration-user-input-parameter) data source type.

## <a name="functions-group"></a>Functions group

### <a name="barcode"></a>Barcode

Use a data source of the ***Barcode*** type to generate an image that represents the bar code for specified text. 

The mandatory **Barcode format** property of the **Barcode** data source specifies the barcode type. The following barcode formats are currently supported:

-   One-dimensional bar codes:
    -   Codabar
    -   Code 39
    -   Code 93
    -   Code 128
    -   EAN-8
    -   EAN-13
    -   ITF-14
    -   Intelligent Mail
    -   MSI
    -   Plessey
    -   PDF417
    -   UPC-A
    -   UPC-E
-   Two-dimensional bar codes:
    -   Aztec
    -   Data Matrix
    -   QR Code

The optional **Width** property specifies the bar code's width in pixels. A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the default width is used. The meaning can vary for different formats.

The optional **Height** property specifies the bar code's height in pixels. A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the default height is used. The meaning can vary for different formats.

The optional **Margin** property specifies the size of the bar code's margin in pixels. The margin is the area on each side of a bar code that must be kept clear (quiet zone). A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the default margin is used. The meaning can vary for different formats.

The **Output content** option specifies whether a bar code image contains the encoded information as text. Set this option to **Yes** to generate a bar code image that contains the encoded information as text. The default value is No.

The mandatory **Encoding** property specifies the type of characters that are encoded in the generated bar code image. By default, the **UTF-8** encoding is used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you add a new **Barcode** data source, you must place it under another item (container) as a nested element. So, the **Barcode** data source will be represented in the configured ER component as a function with the **Value** parameter of the *[String](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#string)* type. Provide the bar code text as the argument of this parameter.

### <a name="calculated-field"></a>Calculated field

Use a data source of the ***Calculated field*** type to configure an ER expression for transforming values of other data sources.

Use the **Edit formula** function to configure an ER expression of the editable data source of the ***Calculated field*** type.

> [!TIP]
> Toggle on the **Show details** option to preview configured expressions for data sources of the ***Calculated field*** type on the **DATA SOURCES** pane of the **Model mapping designer** page and the **Mapping** tab of the **Format designer** page.

The following illustration shows the **Calculated field** data source that has been configured to sort the initially provided list of records in alphabetic order.

![The configured data source of the Calculated field type on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-calc-field-format1.gif)

When you add a new **Calculated field** data source placing it under another item (container) as a nested element, you can specify multiple parameters that you can refer in the configured ER expression. So, you can further configure other formulas to call such a data source controlling the values of arguments of those parameters. Doing that, you can reuse a single data source in many bindings, which reduces the total number of data sources that must be configured in an ER model mapping or ER format component.

### <a name="data-collection"></a>Data collection

You can configure an ER model mapping or an ER format to process certain elements (records of a model mapping data source, format elements, etc.) in a particular order. Additionally, you can configure a data source of the ***Data collection*** type to collect at runtime during elements processing values of data model fields or values of bindings of the processed format elements, do summing of such values, and use the collected values to fill a generated document or perform further calculations.

The mandatory **Item type** property of the **Data collection** data source specifies the type of collected data. The following data types are currently supported:

-   ***[Boolean](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#boolean)***
-   ***[Date](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#date)***
-   ***[DateTime](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#datetime)***
-   ***[GUID](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#guid)***
-   ***[Int64](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#int64)***
-   ***[Integer](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#integer)***
-   ***[Real](er-formula-supported-data-types-primitive.md#real)***
-   String
-   Time

By default, a **Data collection** data source collects only unique values. Use the **Result** property of a **Data collection** data source to access the list of collected values. This property returns a ***[Record list](er-formula-supported-data-types-composite.md#record-list)***. The records of the record list contain the **Value** field that you can use to access collected values.

You can force your data source of the ***Data collection*** type to collect all values. For doing this, do the following:

-   Select one of the following data types for the **Item type** property: ***Int64***, ***Integer***, ***Real***
-   Set the **Collect all values** option of the configured **Data collection** data source to **Yes**.

When the **Collect all values** option is set to **Yes**, the **Sum(Flag)** parameterized property becomes available. You can use this property to get the total amount of all currently collected values. In this property, the **Flag** argument is a ***Boolean*** value that is used to indicate whether the total value must be reset.

-   When the value ***False*** is provided, summing is continued from the previously collected amount.
-   When the value ***True*** is provided, a new summing is started.

The following illustration shows the sample ER format with two data sources of the **Data collection** type:

-   The `Data.Codes` data source is configured to collect unique codes that are placed to a generated document. Then, the configured `Data.Codes.Result` binding is used to place the list of unique codes to the footer of a generated document.
-   The `Data.Total` data source is configured to calculate the total of values that are placed to a generated document. Then, the configured `Data.Total.Sum(true)` binding is used to place this total value to the footer of a generated document.

![The configured data sources of the Data collection type on the Format designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-data-collection-format.png)

The following illustration shows the result of execution of the described above sample ER format with two data sources of the ***Data collection*** type.

### <a name="financial-dimensions-details"></a>Financial dimensions details

When you configure a data source of the ***Table record*** type that refers to an application table for which the relation to financial dimensions is supported, you can see that this ER data source offers a field of the ***Financial dimensions*** type for every financial dimension relation. This field exposes the **Main account and dimensions** record list that allows to access financial dimensions as the list of records. Every record of this list represents a single dimension.

-   The **Definition** record allows you to access a financial dimension metadata.
    -   The **Name** field exposes the name of a financial dimension.
    -   The **Report column name** field exposes the report alias of a financial dimension.
    -   The **Translated name** field exposes the name of a financial dimension in the language that is specified by the [language context](er-design-multilingual-reports.md#language) of the running ER solution.
-   The **Value** record allows you to access a financial dimension value.
    -   The **Code** field returns a financial dimension code.
    -   The **Description** field returns a financial dimension name.

The following illustration shows a field of the ***Financial dimensions*** type of the **Table record** data source that can be used to access default financial dimensions for every record in the **CustInvoiceJour** application table.

![The configured data source of the Table record type on the Model mapping designer page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-fin-dim-mapping1.png)

Use the **Financial dimensions details** data source in the configured ER component to specify how the scope of financial dimensions will be defined for any report that will use this component whenever a field of the ***Financial dimensions*** type is accessed by data consumer. When the **Financial dimensions details** data source is not configured in the editable ER component, all financial dimensions of the current application instance will be used. 

Set the **Ask for dimensions** option of the configured **Financial dimensions details** data source to **Yes** to allow the user to select dimensions in the dialog box at runtime. If set to **No**, all financial dimensions of the current application instance will be used by default.

When the **Ask for dimensions** option is set to **Yes**, the **Financial dimensions selection** option is enabled allowing you to specify the scope of financial dimensions. The following options are available:

-   Select the **All** option to use all financial dimensions of the current application instance.
-   Select the **Legal entity** option to use the only financial dimensions of the company in scope of which an ER solution is executed.
-   Select the **Dimension set** option to use the only financial dimensions of the dimension set that is specified by the user in the dialog box at runtime.

Set the **Ask for main account** option to **Yes** to allow the user to select the main account as part of the list of dimensions in the dialog box at runtime.  If set to **No**, the main account will not be included to the list of dimensions and the **Is main account mandatory** option is enabled. If the **Is main account mandatory** option is set to **Yes**, the main account is included to the list of dimensions regardless of the user's selection.

The following illustration shows the data source of the ***Financial dimensions details*** type that can be used to specify the scope of financial dimensions for the **Financial dimensions*** fields when the configured model mapping is used at runtime.

## <a name="group-by"></a>Group by

You can configure the **Group by** data source to group records of the base data source of the ***Record list*** type. For every generated group of records this data source can calculate various aggregate functions.

The following illustration shows the page using to set up a data source of the ***Group by*** type to group records by code value.

![The configured data source of the Group by type on the Edit Group By parameters page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-groupby-setting1.png)

The following illustration shows the page using to set up a data source of the ***Group by*** type to calculate the total amount for the initial list of records.

![The configured data source of the Group by type on the Edit Group By parameters page.](./media/er-data-sources-ds-groupby-setting2.png)

Configure grouping parameters on the **Edit Group By parameters** page:
-   To specify the base data source for grouping, select the desired data source on the right side of the page and use the **Add field to \> What to group** option.
-   To specify a field for grouping, select the desired field of the specified base data source on the right side of the page and use the **Add field to \> Grouped fields** option.
-   To specify a field for calculation of the aggregated value, select the desired field of the specified base data source on the right side of the page and use the **Add field to \> Aggregation fields** option.
-   Set the **Source list is ordered by group key** option to **Yes** to sort the group of records based on values of fields that have been selected for grouping.

The following aggregate functions are currently supported:

| Name      | Description | Applicability |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| AVG       | Returns the average of the values in a group. | Can be used only with numeric fields. |
| COUNT     | This function returns the number of items that were found in a group. | |
| MIN       | Returns the minimum value among the values in a group. | |
| MAX       | Returns the maximum value among the values in a group. | |
| SUM       | Returns the sum of all the values in a group. | Can be used only with numeric fields. |

Depending on the nature of the base data source, the grouping and aggregation can be performed either on the database level or in memory. To specify execution location, select the desired option for the **Execution location** property of the configured data source:

-   Select the **In memory** option to perform grouping and aggregation in application memory.
-   Select the **Query** option to perform grouping and aggregation in application database when [applicable](er-components-inspections.md#i5).
-   Leave the default **Autodetect** option to let ER identifies the most appropriate execution location:
    -   When the base data source is [queryable](er-components-inspections.md#i5), the **Query** option will be applied when you save changes of the configured data source.
    -   Otherwise, the **In memory** option will be applied.

The configured **Group by** data source exposes a single record for every group of records of the base data source. Notice that this **Group by** data source is structured to expose at runtime results of data grouping and aggregation for each group of records:

-   The **aggregated** record exposes value of each configured aggregation.
-   The **grouped** record exposes value of each grouping field.
-   The **lines** record list exposes records of the base data source that belongs to the current group.

## <a name="join"></a>Join

You can configure the **Join** data source to fetch records of several base data sources and return a joined list of records containing fields from the records of base data sources.

>[!TIP]
> As you may join many data sources with multiple fields, use the **Select fields** function for any base data source of the configured **Join** data source to limit the list of fields the values of which will be fetched at runtime. To learn more, review the [Improve performance of ER solutions by reducing the number of table fields that are fetched at runtime](er-reduce-fetched-fields-number.md) article.

The following types of joins are currently supported:

-   **Outer (left)** join: join all records of the first (left-most) data source and then any matching in accordance to configured conditions records of the second (right-most) data source.
-   **Inner (right)** join: join only records of the first (left-most) data source and only records of the second (right-most) data source matching to each other in accordance to configured conditions.

> [!NOTE]
> You must configure data sources that you want to join as nested fields of the ***Calculated field*** type specifying the join criteria for every configured base data source.

![Review data of the data source of the Table metadata type on the Debug Datasources page.](./media/er-data-sources-metadata-ds-view-data.png)

To learn more about data sources of the ***Table metadata*** type, [download](er-download-configurations-global-repo.md) from the Global repository for review the **German audit file output** ER format configuration. Notice that the downloaded with the selected ER format **Data export model** configuration contains the **German audit file - default groups** model mapping that is configured to use the ***Table metadata*** data source for accessing various application tables. The downloaded **German audit file output** ER format configuration consumes this model mapping to generate country specific audit reports.

## Frequently asked questions

**Question:** I am trying to add a new data source of the ***Table records*** type that refers to a custom table. But I cannot find that table in the lookup of the **Table** field on the data source properties dialog.

**Answer:** The ER metadata of your application instance is obsolete. Use either the **Refill table** or **Rebuild table references** function to refresh the ER metadata aligning it with your source code base.
