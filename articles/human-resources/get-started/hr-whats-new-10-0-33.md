| Feature name | Overview | Release status |
|----|----|----|


## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing 
feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature name | More information | 
|--------------|------------------|


## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default or are now mandatory in version 10.0.32. Most features that have been turned on automatically can
be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have
been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory. This change is made to ensure that customers are using current 
functionality. In this way, as enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, 
unless they are determined to be essential.

| Feature name | Enable date | Feature state | Module |
