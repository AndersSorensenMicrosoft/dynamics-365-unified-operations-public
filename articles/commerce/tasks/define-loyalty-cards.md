This procedure walks through how to define a loyalty card. A loyalty card entitles the card holder to participate in the loyalty programs that are assigned to the card. Loyalty cards can be issued anonymously, or they can be assigned to a specific customer. You can view the loyalty transactions for a specific card, and you can view a summary of loyalty points that have been accumulated on the card. You can issue loyalty cards from any channel. You can also manually adjust a loyalty card to upgrade the customer to a different tier, add loyalty points, or transfer the loyalty point balance from one card to another.

1. Go to Retail and Commerce > Customers > Loyalty > Loyalty cards.
2. Click New.
3. In the Card type field,  click the drop-down button, it has four types:
    * As card tender. The default value indicating the card can only redeem reward points that are earned on itself.
    * As contact tender. The card can redeem reward points that are earned on any cards of the same customer.
    * No tender. The card can only earn reward points but not redeem.
    * Blocked. The card is blocked.
