# Material availability check for work orders

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Supervisors can make a material availability check on work orders. This process is relevant for organizations that want to check if the required spare parts are available before workers start maintenance work. Consider following scenario. A supervisor is responsible for all corrective maintenance on a manufacturing site. As a standard procedure, the supervisor will check all new work orders of type corrective, before releasing the orders to the maintenance workers. 

## How does the material availability check work?

The material availability check is using the standard master planning run to calculate how the required spare parts for work orders are covered in inventory. A material demand for a work order, is generated by a journal line for the material in an un-posted project item journal relating to the work order. A journal line can be created or copied from the work orders item forecast. You can read more about how to use maintenance forecasts here [Maintenance forecasts](maintenance-forecasts.md).

The material availability check is performed in a separate page for a selected range of work orders. From this page, the supervisor can run the master plan and when doing so, that material availability for each of the selected work orders is immediately indicated. In the page, the supervisor is also provided with information about material availability for the individual spare parts required for the selected work orders.




## Check material availability for work orders

1. Go to **Asset management** > **Setup** > **Work orders** > **Maintenance downtime reason codes**.

2. Select **New**.

3. In the **Maintenance downtime reason code** field, enter an ID for the maintenance downtime reason code.

4. In the **Name** field, enter a name.

5. Select the **KPI include** check box if the reason code should be included in calculations of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the asset. In general, planned production stops should not be included in KPI calculations, because they don't affect expected performance.

6. Select **Save**.

The illustration below shows an example of the **Maintenance downtime reason codes** page.

After you've created the maintenance downtime reason codes that you want to use, you can create maintenance downtime registrations for work orders and assets.


## Create maintenance downtime registrations

1. Click **Asset management** > **Work orders** > **All work orders** or **Active work orders**.

2. Select the work order, and then, on the **Work order** tab, in the **Asset** group, select **Maintenance downtime**.

3. Select **New**.

4. In the **From** and **To** fields, define the date and time interval for the maintenance downtime registration.

>[!NOTE]
>When you leave the **To** field, the duration in hours is automatically inserted in the **Duration** field.

5. In the **maintenance downtime reason code** field, select a reason code.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 to add more registrations.

7. Select **Save**.

The illustration below shows an example of maintenance downtime registration.

The calendar that is used to calculate a maintenance downtime registration depends on your selection in the setup of assets and parameters. If a resource is selected on an asset in the **Resource** field on the **Fixed asset** FastTab of the **All assets** page, the calendar that is set up for the associated resource group is used, as shown in the following illustration.

![Figure 3.](media/17-work-orders.png)

If no resource is selected on the asset, the standard calendar that is selected on the **Asset management parameters** page is used, as shown in the following illustration.

To see an overview of all maintenance downtime registrations, click **Asset management** > **Inquiries** > **Maintenance downtime**.

>[!NOTE]
>All calendars that are used in the **Asset Management** module are set up in **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **Calendars** > **Calendars**.
