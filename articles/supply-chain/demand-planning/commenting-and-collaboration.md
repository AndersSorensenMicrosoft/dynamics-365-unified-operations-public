# Commenting and collaboration

You can add comments to a time series to communicate with other users. For example, you might add an explanation about why you chose to edit certain time series values or how to understand a saved data view. Users can also reply to one another's comments, edit or delete comments, and mark comment threads as resolved.

To view and work with comments, open a time series and select the **Commenting Pane** ![](media/image13.png) button at the top-right corner of the page. This opens the commenting pane, which shows all comments made so far for the current series. From here, you can do the following actions:

-   Select **New** to add a new comment.

-   For exiting comments, select the **More thread actions** ![](media/image14.png) button to open a menu where you can choose to edit or delete the selected comment or mark the selected thread as resolved.

-   Reply to an existing comment by entering text in its **Reply** field.
