# Business performance analytics bus matrix

# Definitions
Facts represent a business metric of interest. In the context of Business performance analytics, facts are record-type data such as transactions, orders, and records. Each fact is associated with one or more dimension. Dimensions represent descriptive data elements to provide more information for the facts associated with them.

# Bus matrix

The bus matrix table below shows the relationship between facts and dimensions. The rows represent the dimensions used in Business performance analytics while the columns represent the different facts used in Business performance analytics.
