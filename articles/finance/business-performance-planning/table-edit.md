Table Edit

# Introduction & Purpose

## Overview

The Table Edit Visual is a powerful custom visual that enables direct dimension editing. This functionality offers a multitude of possibilities to modify and manage data directly within your financial planning Power BI reports. It enables:

-   Creating New Scenarios and Versions - allows creation of new forecasting scenarios or versions (e.g., "Forecast," "Version 3").
-   Updating Static Values - allows easy updates to fixed values like 401K match contributions (e.g., 5%).
-   Managing Planning Process Status - enables updates to the status of different planning stages (e.g., "In Review," "Approved").


## Benefits

-   **Enhanced Planning Workflow**

    Empowers users to establish a standardized and controlled workflow in the planning process, ensuring efficiency and consistency.

    -   **Streamlined Functionality**

        Enables diverse functionalities within a single visual tool, facilitating tasks like creating new dimension values or updating existing dimension values.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1.  Import business performance planning visuals from AppSource. [Microsoft AppSource]([https://appsource.microsoft.com])  Learn more about importing visuals [Importing visuals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/import-visual)
2.  Connect PowerBI to your Dataverse environment. [Connect to Dataverse using a Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-powerbi-connector?tabs=Dataverse#connect-to-dataverse-using-a-connector) or [Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery)


[!Tip]  
It is recommended to connect using **Direct Query**.  When using direct query, after the cube is selected, there is an option to **Load selected tables**.  Selecting this option will auto-select any dimension tables that are used in the cube.

## Installation Guide

1.  Open Power BI: Launch the Power BI application and access your desired workspace or report where you intend to configure the visual.
2.  Ensure that the visual has been downloaded from AppSource.  See Pre-requisite step 1 above.  
3.  Position the visual: Drag the visual to the report canvas.
4.  Add your **API Base URL** to the API Details window of the visual. This will provide business performance planning app the details it needs to read and write data from the Cube. To add the API details, select the **Format visual** tab in the report canvas.  The API base URL will be the Environment URL where planning has been installed.  The environment URL must be preceded by https://.  For example:  https://environment.d365.com.  Learn more [Find your environment and organization ID and name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/determine-org-id-name)  Note:The visual must be selected in the report canvas for the Format visual tab to display.




# Using the Visual

## Functionality

**Editing Capabilities**

-   Provides an interface for direct editing of dimensions within Power BI. This enables users to add, modify, or delete rows in selected dimensions.
 
  [!Important] Any user with the **Update dimension data privilege** can edit dimension values.  The out of the box roles of **Administrator, Power User** and **Contributor** have this privilege by default.

        -   Enter a **Description**.
        -   Repeaat the same steps to add **Forecast Downside**.
        -   Click **Save** icon to save changes.
          
    -   Utilizing Created Scenarios

        The newly added scenarios (**Forecast Upside**, **Forecast Downside**) can be utilized for **what-if** **analyses** and exploration within D365 Finance business performance planning and Power BI. Examples include modeling sales forecasts based on various economic environments or creating different budget versions and approval statuses.
