# Rolling Forecasts on the Demand Planning Application

Rolling forecasts are a way of continuously updating and extending the forecast horizon based on the latest data and assumptions. Rolling forecasts help to align the demand planning process with the changing business environment and improve the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts.
Set up rolling forecasts
To automatically run a smooth rolling forecast, each of the steps (import data, run a transformation, run a calculation, run a forecast and export the forecast) can be fully automated by scheduling it. 
Each of these steps can be scheduled either on:
-	A recurrent basis: calendar based, that will be triggered when the certain time and date are met according to the setup recurrence, daily, weekly or monthly. In the case that it is set every X time, the first instance will be the first one according to the start date, and then the X time will be set between the 
-	Event triggered: when a certain event occurs. This will be the case of when new historical data exists for the case of transformations, or when there is a new version of the input time series for the given step. Note event trigger will be available after the April release. 
For each process, the schedule that applies will be shown. For example, for import the only available option will be to schedule. For transformation it will be recurrent or when new historical data has been imported. For the rest of the processes it will be either recurrent or when a new version of the existing time series exists. 
To create the schedule there are two options:
-	When you are creating the profile:  on the section Set run schedule on the wizard, it will allow you to create the recurrence and allow it to automatically run. Note you will need an existing time series if you want to run the fully automated process, so it is recommended that you use first the profile with a manual run and then use the existing time series. 
-	Once the profile is created: to add or modify the schedule to go the Run Schedule tab on the profile itself and modify the settings
When scheduling for the Output settings, it is possible to create a new time series every time or to create a new version of the same time series. It is recommended to create a new version of the same (existing time series) so the process can be fully automated. To keep traceability of the whole process it is also recommended to Save current version as new version before overwriting. 

## Example of setup 
In the following example, it is illustrated how the process for automated rolling forecasts could be implemented. 
 
 

Note that on a continuous basis, if the forecast is fully recalculated, the baseline forecast will be automatically recalculated and edits done during the previous period will not be kept. 

How to use rolling forecasts
Once you have set up the rolling forecasts on the demand planning application, you can use the same worksheet to compare the historical demand, the current forecast and the previous forecast. You can also modify, review and edit the forecast as needed. The rolling forecasts will automatically update and extend the forecast horizon based every time there is a new run. 
Rolling forecasts can help you to monitor the performance of your demand planning process, identify and address issues by collaborating on the same forecast, and adjust your plans accordingly. Rolling forecasts can also help you to communicate and collaborate with other stakeholders, such as sales, marketing and finance, and align your demand planning with the strategic goals of the organization.
