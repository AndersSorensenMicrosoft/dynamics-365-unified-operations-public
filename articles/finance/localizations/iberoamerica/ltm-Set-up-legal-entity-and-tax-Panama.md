# Set up legal entity and tax information for Panama

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This article explains how to set up a legal entity and the tax information for a company located in Panama who is using the LATAM features available in Dynamics 365 Finance. A legal entity represents the company and contains the tax and legal attributes required for the rest of the LATAM configuration.
Before you begin, go to the **Feature management** workspace, and verify that the feature, **LATAM globalization expansion â€“ Panama** is enabled. If it's not, enable it. When you have verified that the feature is enabled, complete the following steps.

## Create a legal entity
1.  Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**, and select **New** to create a new legal entity. Some functionalities are enabled only for Panama. For example, specific tax reports or electronic invoices.
2.  In the address setup, set up the Panama address format using **State** as "Province", **County** as "District" and **City** as "Corregimiento".
3.  Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **LATAM** > **LATAM parameters**.
4.  On the **Concept and notes** tab, set a field in the **Legal entity** section as **Activity**.
 

## Set up tax information

1.  [Create a document class letter](../ltm-core-document-class-letter.md) without a prefix. This document class letter will be used in taxpayer and document class configurations.
2.  Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **LATAM** > **Tax ID type**.
3.  Select **New** and in the **Overview** section, in the **Tax ID type** field, enter **RUC** (Unique Taxpayer Registry), which is one of the tax ID types for Panama.
4.  In the **Format** field, enter **XXXXXXXX-XX**. For more information, see [Tax ID types](ltm-core-tax-id-type.md).
5.  Go to **Organization administration** > **Global address book** > **Addresses**, select the country where the company is set and select **LATAM** to add the tax ID type **RUC**. For more information, see [Address setup for Latin America](ltm-core-address-setup.md).
6.  Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **LATAM** > **Taxpayer type** and select **New** to create a new record that represents organizations.
7.  In the **Type** field, select **persona juridica** and add the tax ID type and the document class letter you created. For more information, see [Tax payer type](ltm-core-taxpayer-type.md).
8.  Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.and in the **LATAM** section, configure the following entity tax and legal information:

    - Taxpayer type: Select **persona juridica** to represent an organization.
    - Based in country/region: Select **Panama**.
    - Country document type: Select **RUC**.
