# Release schedule for Proactive Quality Updates

This article provides the release schedule for Proactive Quality Updates (PQUs).

The schedule for each PQU train and its corresponding build app version number is published seven days prior to the start of the PQU train. Five days before a PQU is applied, Microsoft sends a notification to customers who use the environments that will receive the update.

Station 1 is the first release station, and it consists of customers who opt in their sandbox environment(s) to receive the update before all other stations. More details will be published once this functionality is made generally available in May 2023.

To determine when your Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Service (LCS) environment will be updated, find the region and the station to region mapping and cross reference with the upcoming PQU train for a service update. There is a high-level schedule for 2023 that outlines the train schedule for every service update this year if customers need to plan for a PQU ahead of time.

For information on the maintenance windows for each region, see [What are the planned maintenance windows by region?](../../dev-itpro/deployment/plannedmaintenance-selfservice.md#windows).

## Stations to Region Mapping

| Stations  | Regions  |
| --------- | -------- |
| Station 1 | To be determined later |
| Station 2 | Canada Central, Canada East, France Central, India Central, Norway East, Switzerland West |
| Station 3 | France South, India South, Norway West, Switzerland North, South Africa North, Australia East, UK South, UAE North, </br> Japan East, Australia South East, South East Asia |

> [!Important]
> The PQU build for every train is typically published to Lifecycle Services the same day or the day after the change cutoff date as shown in the high level PQU train schedule, for customers to download and self-apply the build as needed to frontload any testing requirements. Standard performance test (tier4), Premium performance test (tier5) sandboxes and production environments will receive PQUs on weekends.
