# Manage payment authorizations

This article provides an overview of payment authorization expiration ranges and common payment authorization parameters in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Authorization expiration ranges

Authorizations from payment method issuers may vary in their average expiration dates, depending on the payment method used. Each authorization expiration date may vary, and there's no guaranteed timeline that each payment method follows. Individual authorization requests may expire if the issuer has reason to end the active authorization initially provided at the origination of the authorization. Depending on the specific payment methods that are used in your environment and with your payment gateway, you can adjust Commerce configuration parameters that apply to your solution to optimally capture the date ranges needed to manage authorizations while orders are being fulfilled.

For the out-of-the-box connectors currently supported by Commerce, the commonly advised ranges of authorization expiration are:

- PayPal authorizations: Up to 29 days (but can expire earlier in some cases).
- Credit card authorizations (via Adyen): Typically 14 days (dependent on each issuer).
  
> [!NOTE]
> The advised expiration ranges provided above are suggestions and not exact timeframes of what you may experience or use to configure for your environment based on the range of methods used.

## Authorization expiration reauthorization parameters

The **Number of days before expired** parameter (found in Commerce headquarters at **Accounts receivable \> Setup \> Accounts receivable parameters \> Credit card**) controls the behavior of your environment's payment connector by preemptively voiding and reauthorizing authorizations against the gateway to secure a renewed authorization prior to expiring. 

For Adyen, the void and reauthorization pattern works to renew the authorization for a new cycle. Adyen's use of recurring tokens for the transaction scope can procure an authorized token for upcoming calls while referencing the same transactional scope as the original customer-approved and validated authorization. If you set the **Number of days before expired** parameter for a time range longer than the typical token expiration timeframe, there's a risk that the system may initially see the capture token accepted with a transactional response, but if the capture is later rejected in the gateway, the system won't be aware of the status change. 

> [!NOTE]
> The capture response is the status notification that the gateway received the network call. The capture result is the actual resulting status of capture action in the gateway. The capture result takes time to be determined and confirmed by the issuer, which makes capture results asynchronous to the Commerce system. Knowing the capture result and documenting it in the system will require the future Commerce asynchronous payments feature to update the transaction with the capture result. Currently, the transaction's authorization is checked prior to the capture call, and the capture is then considered successful. It is rare for a capture to fail with a successful authorization, but it may occur. Capture results can be compared during the reconciliation process.

With PayPal, the tokens can remain authorized up to 29 days. However, the **Number of days before expired** parameter will void PayPal's token without the ability to renew it unless the **OrderIntent** parameter (available starting in Commerce version 10.0.30) is configured. For PayPal, tokens are single use, and the **OrderIntent** parameter's action will void the token without the ability to recover a new order authorization. Voided PayPal tokens require reobtaining a payment from the customer for PayPal orders.  With the **OrderIntent** parameter set to **Save** in the connector configuration, the **Number of days before expired** parameter extends the order expiration duration for PayPal tokens. Without **OrderIntent** set to **Save**, the **Number of days before expired** parameter should be set to a balanced number of days that works best for both the Adyen and PayPal Connectors (if using both), and where invoicing will occur within the regular timeframe the token is valid. The recommended setting for **Number of days before expired** is 14 days. 

For more information on the PayPal order intent setting, see [PayPal order intent](#paypal-connector-order-intent-parameter).

## Authorization resubmit job parameters

The **Authorization Resubmit** job (located in headquarters at **Retail and Commerce \> Retail and Commerce IT \> Payments \> Authorization resubmit**) is a batch job that can be set at a specific recurring cadence to reauthorize payment authorization tokens that are within the range specified by the **Number of days before expired** parameter.

The **Authorization resubmit** flyout form includes the following parameters:

- **Days out**: Reviews the set shipping date for a sales order and triggers reauthorization based on shipping date set. The **Days out** parameter works in addition to the **Number of days before expired** parameter.
- **Check inventory availability**: A legacy batch job parameter that is no longer supported.  
- **Release and authorize future orders**: Acts against orders set with a future order date to remove their "don't process" holds and authorize the amount as the configured order shipping date approaches.
- **Retry declined credit cards**: Retries a card authorization on a previously declined card. This parameter may not be a desired action per your business requirements.
- **Resubmit stale credit cards**: Resubmits a card for authorization after the system has determined an expired authorization. This parameter may not be a desired action per your business requirements.
- **Void expired authorizations**: Voids the authorization if the system determines it meets the expired settings.

Under the **Run in the background** section of the form:

- **Batch processing**: This parameter is set to **Yes** by default and can't be turned off.
- **Recurrence**: The parameters on the **Recurrence \> Define recurrence** tab allow you to set recurrence timing configurations to run the job.
- **Alerts**: The parameters on the **Alerts \> Batch job alerts** tab allow you to configure alerts for different events related to the batch job.
- **Task description**: Specifies the batch job display label.
- **Batch group**: Used to specify batch groups to distribute the workload to different servers.
- **Private**: When this parameter is set to **Yes**, Commerce restricts other users from processing your batch job. Only the user who configured the form will be able to run the job.
- **Critical Job**: Setting this parameter to **Yes** prioritizes processing capacity for the job.
- **Monitoring category**: Allows you to assign a monitoring category to make it easier to identify different types of jobs during monitoring.

## PayPal connector order intent parameter

Beginning in Commerce version 10.0.30, the PayPal payment connector configuration in headquarters includes the **OrderIntent** field, which allows the configuration of the PayPal payment connector to operate with a saved order with the PayPal service for the online channel. For more information about Commerce support for PayPal order intent, see [Order Intent](../paypal.md#order-intent).

## Adyen connector authorization stale period parameter

When configuring the Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen in headquarters for online, call center, or Hardware Station, the **Authorization stale period (days)** parameter specifies the number of days after which the connector will view the authorization token as expired. Dynamics proactively sets a decline status on a capture if the authorization token is older than the days specified for this attribute, and generates the error `Capture failed: Capture failed due to stale authorization.(22062)`. When declined, the capture call generates the error in the system prior to calling the payment gateway (Adyen). This parameter prevents unnecessary capture requests for authorizations that are likely to fail, avoiding unnecessary transactional attempt charges. 

The **Authorization stale period (days)** parameter in the Adyen connector configuration should be set to a longer timeframe than the accounts receivable **Number of days before expired** parameter value, because the **Authorization stale period (days)** parameter triggers the protective action to consider the authorization expired.
