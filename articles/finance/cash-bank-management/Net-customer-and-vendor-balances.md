# Net customer and vendor balances

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Customer and vendor balance netting is a process where the balances for a vendor and customer are netted against each other because the vendor and customer are the same party. This approach minimizes the exchange of money between an organization and the customer or vendor party. It can also help a company avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and save on transaction fees, by consolidating the companyâ€™s customer and vendor balances.

This article provides an overview of the customer and vendor balances netting process in Dynamics 365 Finance. This article also explains how to set up the netting agreement, manual net customer and vendor balances, automatic net customer and vendor balances, and reverse posted netting transactions.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a preview feature in Dynamics 365 Finance 10.0.38. The feature is available in sandbox only and general availability date in Production environment will be announced later.

2. Create a main account as the bridging account for netting purpose.

## Set up netting agreement

4. Select the main account defined earlier.

7. Activate the netting agreement.

## Manual netting

You can manually net customer and vendor balances by selecting the open customer invoices and vendor invoices. The system automatically calculates the minimal amount between selected customer invoices balance and vendor invoice balance as the netting amount. A netting journal is posted automatically with two journal lines. One journal line automatically settles the selected customer invoices, and the other line automatically settles the selected vendor invoices.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Payments** > **Netting** > **Customer and vendor balances netting**, or **Accounts receivable** > **Payments** > **Netting** > **Customer and vendor balances netting**.
2. All the pairs of customer account and vendor account available for netting are displayed on this page. Select one of the pairs, and then select **Create Netting**.
3. Select the open customer invoices and open vendor invoices that you want to net, and select **Post**.

## Automatic netting

You can automatically net customer and vendor balances by defining a netting rule and then running it through a batch job or the process automation framework.

   - By invoice balance - From smallest to largest

4. Select the netting agreement scope. If you select **All**, all the active netting agreements are included in this rule; If you select **Selected**, you should define a netting agreement list.
5. In the **Include credit not and debit note** field, in the automatic netting, select **Yes** or **No**.
6. On the **Netting criteria** FastTab define the criteria if users only want to automatically net certain vendor accounts, customer accounts, or invoice currency.
