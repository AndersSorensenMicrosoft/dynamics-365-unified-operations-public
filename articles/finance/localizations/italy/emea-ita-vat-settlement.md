# Sales tax settlement and numbering of pages in Sales tax books

The topic describes specifics of Sales tax settlement process for legal entities with primary address in Italy and how to manage the numbering of pages in Sales tax books.

As of 10.0.39 version of Dynamics 365 Finance, the **Italian sales tax books** functionality supports reporting of Italian sales tax book in [Electronic reporting (ER) tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting) and accomodates reporting for [multiple VAT registrations](../global/emea-multiple-vat-registration-numbers.md). 

**Sales tax settlement** process can be executed independently from **Italian sales tax books** functionality. To separate sales tax settlement process from generation of Italian sales tax book in electronic reporting, enable **Separate sales tax payment report generation from sales tax settlement** feature in **Feature management**. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). When **Separate sales tax payment report generation from sales tax settlement** feature is disabled, the Italian sales tax book in ER is generated automatically after the settlement is completed. 

**Sales tax settlement** process can be run in batch mode. Select **Use batch processing for sales tax settlement** check box parameter for the **Sales tax settlement period** in **Tax > Indirect taxes > Sales tax > Sales tax settlement periods** to enable executing of tha sales tax settlement process for the settlement period as batch job in the background. This is recommended for a large number of tax transactions within a period interval.

Per Italian legislation, rules apply to settlement periods. For example, after the settlement period is closed, no change is allowed. You are required to report if the settlement refers to the last period on the fiscal year. View the settlement period status and report if it refers to a year closing. To support these rules, Ñˆn legal entities with address in Italy, on **Sales tax settlement periods** page there are following columns added for **Period intervals**.

|    <strong>Field</strong>    |                                   <strong>Description</strong>                                    |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   <strong>Closed</strong>    | Indicates if the interval of the sales tax settlement period has been settled and closed. |
| <strong>Last period</strong> |             Select this option if the period is the last period in a sales tax year.              |

When the **Sales tax settlement** process is executed, the **Closed** parameter is selected for related **Period interval** automatically. This field is updated with the closing date of the tax period. You can't post or reverse an invoice that has a date that is earlier than the closing date of the tax period.

As of 10.0.39 version of Dynamics 365 Finance, when [Italian sales tax book in Electronic reporting (ER) tool is enabled](emea-ita-sales-tax-books.md), numbers of pages of Italian sales tax book is updated only when [Italian sales tax books electronic report is generated](emea-ita-sales-tax-books.md#generate-italian-sales-tax-books-electronic-report) with selected **Update number of pages** checkbox parameter.
