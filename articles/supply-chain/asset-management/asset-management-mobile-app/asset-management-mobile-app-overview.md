The Asset Management mobile app provides the following capabilities for workers and organizations using Asset Management for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management:

- **Manage work orders**: Maintenance workers use work orders as a daily to-do list that provides the information necessary to complete their planned maintenance tasks. In the app, workers can search for work orders assigned to them. Workers then use the app to record their progress so the system can track labor, materials, and services for the work done. Workers can create new work orders, process existing orders, and perform tasks such as updating checklist items, updating asset counters, registering time and material, and viewing and adding notes.

- **Create maintenance requests**: Administrators can use the role-based security setup in Supply Chain Management to grant workers permission to create new maintenance requests. Workers that receive this permission will then be able to use the mobile app to proactively request maintenance of assets.

To use the app, you must have a fully implemented setup of Asset Management on your Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management environment.
