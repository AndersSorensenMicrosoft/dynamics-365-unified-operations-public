# Calculations

The Demand planning app lets you build a collection of *calculation profiles*, each of which takes one or more existing time series as input, then applies a set of predefined calculations to generate a new time series as output. You might use calculations for any of the following purposes and more:

-   Increase all forecast by 10%

-   Combine two different forecasts, which result is using the average of the two

-   Remove outliers on the forecast by removing out some values that may be completely our of range&lt;Example&gt;

Typically, a manager or system administrator will create the initial collection required profiles and, after that, forecasters and other users will be able to run the profiles to generate new calculated time series as needed.
