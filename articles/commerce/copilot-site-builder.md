If you run an e-commerce website, you know the importance of having engaging and persuasive product enrichment and marketing content that can attract and convert your customers. But creating such content can be time-consuming and challenging, especially if you have a large product catalog and a diverse audience. That's why Microsoft has introduced Copilot in site builder, a new AI-powered tool that helps you generate high-quality content with ease and efficiency.

Copilot in site builder works seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce site builder to help you quickly creating product enrichment and marketing content that is tailored to your target audience and brand tone. Site builder offers a range of templates, features, and tools to help you customize your website to meet your needs and preferences. With Copilot in site builder, you can generate persuasive, compelling, and engaging product enrichment and marketing content for your e-commerce websites quickly and efficiently. 

You can use Copilot in site builder to initiate the creative process by first selecting a tone that aligns to your brand, for example "adventurous," "luxurious," or "bold." Next you can select an audience from choices managed by you, for example "sports enthusiast" or "college graduate." Copilot then uses these prompts to craft compelling and engaging content based on existing product information such as name, description, attributes, and price.

- **Choose the messaging tone** - You can select the voice that best fits your brand and audience, and specify a unique tone for each product. The tone of message for a product can be adventurous, casual, luxurious, formal, informational, educational, and more.
- **Create custom messages for specific buyers** - Select the intended audience to create custom messages for specific buyers such as new parents, graduates, senior citizens, and health care workers.
- **Amplify with key highlights** - Augment your content with key highlights specific to a product using natural language, and generate engaging text snippets that help amplify key highlights for your product.
- **Make basic modifications** - Easily make basic text modifications using an inline rich text editor or by providing key prompts to format text using natural language.

## Selective content filtering 

Microsoft is committed to providing you with a responsible and ethical solution for your e-commerce needs, and has designed Copilot in site builder to avoid the promotion of products from sensitive and regulated industries such as alcohol, tobacco, and soft drugs by default. We believe that such content filtering is a best practice to protect your customers and your reputation.

However, it is understood that you may have different preferences and requirements for your business. Site administrators have the ability to override the default behavior and customize the product enrichment and marketing content that Copilot in site builder generates. You can easily change the settings and choose which products you want to promote and how, and so have the full control and flexibility to make the best decisions for your business.

To override content filtering restrictions in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Site settings \> Copilot**.
1. Under **Content filtering**, for the content themes you want to override, set the options to **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot settings for tones, target clients, and sensitive/regulated industries are predefined by system. If you have feedback or requests to revise or add more options, contact Microsoft support.

5. You can select some product information that you want Copilot to use as input, such as Price, Attributes, Description, and Dimensions. You can also unselect fields if you don't want to include them.

For example, you can tell Copilot to highlight the benefits of the product and then make adjustments to use a friendly tone, or target a specific audience. If you don't provide any instructions, Copilot uses the default options from your site settings.

9. After you enter the instructions, Copilot will process them and generate a response based on the product information and your instructions. You can see the response in the preview window.
10. If you aren't satisfied with the response, you can change the selection of product information or update the instructions and click on the 'Generate' (Arrow icon) again.
11. Copilot creates a new response based on the updated input. You can repeat this process as many times as you want until you get a response that meets your expectations.

12. Once you're satisfied with the response, you can click on the 'Use response' button. This action copies the response to the text or content block that you selected in step 2.
13. You can still review and edit the response in the text or content block if you want to make any final changes. You can also add images, links, or other elements to enhance your product page.
