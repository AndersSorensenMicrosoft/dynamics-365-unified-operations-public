# Import data overview

You can import data from a variety of sources and file types, including directly from Supply Chain Management or by importing text files in Microsoft Excel or CSV format. You can also import data stored in an Azure data lake.  

You can use Power Query to transform the data before importing it into Demand planning if needed.

The Demand planning app lets you build a collection of *import profiles*, each of which imports data from a specific external source into one or more specific tables in Demand planning. Typically, a manager or system administrator will create the initial collection required profiles and, after that, forecasters and other users will be able to run the profiles to update the data as needed.

It is also possible to import your custom data entities into tables or custom fields that you may have extended in the standard tables without the need for a developer, doing it from the standard user interface.
