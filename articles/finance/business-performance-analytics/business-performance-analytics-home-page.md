Business performance analytics helps simplify the process of gaining insights from data by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly view across multiple business processes and delivering insights directly to all users. Finance professionals can make informed decisions without having to have advanced skills or understand data science. Business performance analytics lets user focus on strategic initiatives while they also streamline financial reporting and shorten cycle times.

Business performance analytics enhances capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance by taking advantage of unified data for AI and machine learning, so that teams can automatically identify opportunities for improving financial performance. Through AI-powered solutions, Microsoft can help protect organizations from risk and guard against future disruption by taking advantage of its partnership with Open AI and recent acquisitions in business domains such as process mining and AI-driven spend analytics.

Business performance analytics enables reporting in a more holistic, less siloed way across multiple systems of record by normalizing data. It's built on Dataverse and includes a web-based reporting hub where users can create reporting via Excel, Power BI, and other templates. Therefore, users can easily access and analyze data.
