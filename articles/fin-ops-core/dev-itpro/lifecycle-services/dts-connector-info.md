The Dynamics 365 Translation Service connector integrates with the Power Platform, enabling users to access DTS directly from a flow or app. This connector calls the DTS API on its user's behalf, saving them a trip to the website.

The following functionality is supported:
- Translate user interface (UI) files
- Regenerate translation requests
- Creating translation memory (TM) files
