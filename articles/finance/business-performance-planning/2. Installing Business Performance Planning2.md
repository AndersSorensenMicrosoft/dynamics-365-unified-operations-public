## System requirements

A Tier-2 environment (multi-box) is required to install business performance planning. For more information about environments, see [Environment planning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning). Business performance planning is currently supported in the following geographies: Australia, Brazil, UK, USA, Europe, Canada, France, Germany, India, Norway, Switzerland, UAE, South America, South Africa and Japan. Confirm the environment where you plan to install Business performance planning is in one of the above mentioned regions.

## Version requirements

While not required, Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.37 and PU 61 provides additional options for getting general ledger information into a balance format via process automations.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can install Business performance planning, the Power Platform environment must be created.

In order to use the functionality in Dynamics 365 Finance business performance planning a Finance premium license must be purchased, and available on the tenant.

Important! If a Finance license not purchased, Business performance planning will not display in the Power Platform Admin Center as a D365 App to install. To perform any planning operations, you will need a Finance premium license.
