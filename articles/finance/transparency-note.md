# Transparency notes for Dynamics 365 Finance 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who use it, the people affected by it, and the environment in which it's deployed. Creating a system that's fit for its intended purpose requires an understanding of how the technology works, its capabilities and limitations, and how to achieve the best performance. Microsoft's transparency notes are intended to help you understand how AI technology works, the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment. You can use transparency notes when developing or deploying your own system, or share them with the people who will use or be affected by your system.

Transparency notes are part of a broader effort to put Microsoft's AI principles into practice. To find out more, see [Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).
