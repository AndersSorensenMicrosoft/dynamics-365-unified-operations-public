Most features that have been turned on automatically can be turned off in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory.

Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they're determined to be essential.
