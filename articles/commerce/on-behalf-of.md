# Enable on behalf of capabilities for B2B e-commerce sites

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes a new capability of B2B account managers to sign in to the B2B e-commerce website and perform operations on behalf of B2B buyers.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Dynamics 365 Commerce version 10.0.33 and later releases.

## Overview

Retailer representatives (typically, account managers) can sign in to the B2B e-commerce website and select a B2B buyer organization and a buyer that they want to work on behalf of. The account manager can then view the same products, prices, promotions, and discount experience as the buyer and can add items to a cart and place orders on behalf of the buyer. 

## Prerequisites
To enable this feature, Azure Active Directory B2B application needs to be [created](obo-create-aad-application.md). In addition, a B2B sign-in page in **site builder** needs to be [configured](obo-add-pages-site-builder.md). Finally, Dynamics 365 environment should be [configured](obo-configure-hq.md) accordingly. 

## Experience
  
Account manager should sign-in into B2B e-Commerce site by clicking **Sign-in**, and then clicking a button **Employee sign-in**:

Once these selections are made, the account manager is now representing the buyer they have selected and has full access to their account information, pricing, catalog information and discounts. The account manager can now put the items in the cart and create an order, utilizing full e-Commerce experience. The completed orders will be easily distinguishable  from the regular orders since they will be prefixed with the account manager name. The account manager can create a template for the buyer to use later. It is recommended to create a distinctive name for the template that includes the account manager name and a purpose of the template.
