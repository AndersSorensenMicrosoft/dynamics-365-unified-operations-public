# Latin America overview
In Latin America (LATAM), Dynamics 365 Finance has previously supported out-of-the-box localizations for Brazil and Mexico. With 2023 release wave 1, we delivered out-of-the-box localizations for more countries/regions in LATAM. In subsequent release waves we continue to extend the scope of the supported countries in LATAM to address the needs of multiple global and local customers. Over time, the total number of out-of-the-box localized countries in LATAM will be 16. 

Tax compliance requirements are complex and change frequently. Companies are looking for more out-of-the-box geographic coverage and tax compliance automation from Microsoft. Shipping localizations for additional LATAM countries significantly extends our country support in LATAM beyond our current support and provides customers with more consistent out-of-the-box regulatory compliance coverage in multiple areas including tax reporting and electronic invoicing.

## Country/region localization availability

Some of the functionality referred in this article may not be available for the LATAM county/regions yet. Delivery timelines may change and projected functionality may not be released (see [Microsoft policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007332)).
