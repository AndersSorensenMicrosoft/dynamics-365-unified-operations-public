# View and run existing data import profiles

You only need to import data as often as the relevant data changes in the external systems. Some profiles will only need to be run occasionally, while others might be run nearly every time a user works with the app.

To refresh your data by running an existing data import profile, follow these steps:

1.  On the navigation pane, select **Data Providers &gt; Import**.

2.  Find the profile for the type of import you want to run and select the link in its **Name** column.

3.  The detail page opens for your selected profile. It provides the following tabs:

    - **Summary** – Provides basic information about the profile. If you like, you can edit the **Name** and/or **Description** to make the profile easier to identify and work with.

    - **Jobs** – Shows a list of each time the profile was run, include date information, job status, the provider used, the table updated, and the number of records imported. Links are provided for more information.

4.  To run the profile, select **Run** on the Action Pane. This command adds a new row to the grid on the **Jobs** tab, where you can follow the status of the new import. The page doesn't refresh automatically, so you must select **Refresh** in the grid toolbar to refresh the status information.
