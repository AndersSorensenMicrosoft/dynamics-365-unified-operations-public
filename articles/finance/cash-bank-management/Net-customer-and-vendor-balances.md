# Net customer and vendor balances



Customer and vendor balance netting is a process where the balances for a vendor and customer are netted against each other because the vendor and customer are the same party. This approach minimizes the exchange of money between an organization and the customer/vendor party. It can help a company avoid making unnecessary payments or receipts, and save on transaction fees, by consolidating the companyâ€™s customer and vendor balances.

This article provides an overview of the process of customer and vendor balances netting in Dynamics 365 Finance. It explains how to set up the netting agreement, manual net customer and vendor balances, automatic net customer and vendor balances, and reverse posted netting transactions.

One journal line will automatically settle the selected customer invoices, and the other line will automatically settle the selected vendor invoices.

1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Payments** > **Netting** > **Customer and vendor balances netting**, or **Accounts receivable** > **Payments** > **Netting** > **Customer and vendor balances netting**.
