The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this 
article was initially published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|--------------|---------|------------------|------------|


## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing 
feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|

## Features turned on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.33. Most features that have been turned on atomically can be turned off in 
[Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md). In the future, some features that have been turned on 
automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory. This change ensures that customers are using current functionality, so that as 
enhancements are added, they can build on the current functionality. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year, unless they are determined to 
be essential.

| Feature name | Enable date | Feature state | Module |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------|



## Features removed from Feature management

The following table lists the features that have been removed from Feature management in version 10.0.33.

### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Finance](removed-deprecated-features-finance.md) article describes features that have been removed or deprecated for
Dynamics 365 Finance.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Finance](removed-deprecated-features-finance.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 
months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
