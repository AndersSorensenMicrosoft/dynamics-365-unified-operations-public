# Submit VAT return in XML to the Danish Tax Agency

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to set up the value-added tax (VAT) declaration for Denmark and preview it in Microsoft Excel.

To automatically generate the report, first create enough sales tax codes to keep a separate VAT accounting for each box on the advance VAT declaration. Additionally, in the application-specific parameters of the Electronic reporting (ER) format for the advance VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes with the lookup result of the lookups for the boxes on the VAT declaration.

For Denmark, you must configure **Report field lookup**. For more information about how to set up application-specific parameters, see the [Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields](#set-up-application-specific-parameters) section later in this article.

In the following table, the "Lookup result" column shows the lookup result that is preconfigured for a specific VAT declaration row in the VAT declaration format. Use this information to correctly associate sales tax codes with the lookup result and then with the row of the VAT declaration.



## Configure system parameters

To generate a VAT declaration, you must configure the VAT number.

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Legal entities**.
2. Select the legal entity, and then select **Registration IDs**.
3. Select or create the address in Denmark, and then, on the **Registration ID** FastTab, select **Add**.
4. In the **Registration type** field, select the registration type that is dedicated to Denmark, and that uses the **VAT Id** registration category.
5. In the **Registration number** field, enter the tax number.
6. On the **General** tab, in the **Effective** field, enter the date when the number becomes effective.

For more information about how to set up registration categories and registration types, see [Registration IDs](emea-registration-ids.md).

## Set up a VAT declaration preview for Denmark

### Import ER configurations

Open the **Electronic reporting** workspace, and import the **VAT Declaration Excel (DK)** ER format.

For more information, see [Download ER configurations from the Global repository of Configuration service](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md).

### <a name="set-up-application-specific-parameters"></a>Set up application-specific parameters for VAT declaration fields

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable the feature, **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** in the **Feature management** workspace. When this feature is enabled, parameters that are configured for the earlier version of an ER format automatically become applicable for the later version of the same format. If this feature is not enabled, you must configure application-specific parameters explicitly for each format version. The **Use application specific parameters from previous versions of ER formats** feature is available in the **Feature management** workspace starting in Finance version 10.0.23. For more information about how to set up the parameters of an ER format for each legal entity, see [Set up the parameters of an ER format per legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-app-specific-parameters-set-up.md).

To automatically generate a VAT declaration, associate sales tax codes in the application and lookup results in the ER configuration.

Follow these steps to define which sales tax codes generate which boxes on the VAT declaration.

## Set up electronic messages

### Download and import the data package that has example settings for electronic messages

The data package contains electronic message settings that are used to preview the VAT declaration in Excel. You can extend these settings or create your own. For more information about how to work with electronic messaging and create your own settings, see [Electronic messaging](../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.md).

1. In [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2), in the Shared asset library, select **Data package** as the asset type, and then download **DK VAT declaration package**. The downloaded file is named **DK VAT declaration package.zip**.
2. In Finance, in the **Data management** workspace, select **Import**.
3. On the **Import** FastTab, in the **Group name** field, enter a name for the job.
4. On the **Selected entities** FastTab, select **Add file**.
5. In the **Add file** dialog box, verify that the **Source data format** field is set to **Package**, select **Upload and add**, and then select the zip file that you downloaded earlier.
6. Select **Close**.
7. After the data entities are uploaded, on the Action Pane, select **Import**.
8. Go to **Tax** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Electronic messages** > **Electronic messages**, and validate the electronic message processing that you imported (**DK VAT declaration**).

### Configure electronic messages

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Electronic messages** > **Populate records actions**.
2. Select the line for **DK Populate VAT return records**, and then select **Edit query**.
3. Use the filter to specify the settlement periods to include on the report.
4. If you must report tax transactions from other settlement periods in a different declaration, create a new **Populate records** action, and select the appropriate settlement periods.

## Generate a VAT declaration from electronic messages

When you use electronic messages to generate the report, you can collect tax data from multiple legal entities. For more information, see the [Run a VAT declaration for multiple legal entities](#run-vat-declaration) section later in this article.

The following procedure applies to the electronic message processing example that you imported earlier from the LCS Shared asset library.

1. Go to **Tax \> Inquiries and reports \> Electronic messages \> Electronic messages**.
2. In the left pane, select **DK VAT declaration**.
3. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **New**, and then, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **OK**.
4. Select the message line that is created, enter a description, and then specify the start and end dates for the declaration.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Steps 5 through 7 are optional.

5. Optional: On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Collect data**, and then select **OK**. The sales tax payments that were generated earlier are added to the message. For more information, see the [Settle and post sales tax](#settle-and-post-sales-tax) section earlier in this article. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
6. Optional: On the **Message items** FastTab, review the sales tax payments that are transferred for processing. By default, all sales tax payments of the selected period that weren't included in any other message of the same processing are included.
7. Optional: Select **Original document** to review the sales tax payments or select **Delete** to exclude sales tax payments from processing. If you skip this step, you can still generate a VAT declaration by using the **Tax declaration version** field in the **Declaration** dialog box.
8. On the **Messages** FastTab, select **Update status**. In the **Update status** dialog box, select **Ready to generate**, and then select **OK**. Verify that the message status is changed to **Ready to generate**.
9. Select **Generate report**. To preview the VAT declaration amounts, in the **Run processing** dialog box, select **Preview report**, and then select **OK**.
10. In the **Electronic reporting parameters** dialog box, set the fields as described in the [Preview the VAT declaration in Excel from the Report sales tax for settlement period periodic task](#preview-vat-excel) section earlier in this article, and then select **OK**.
11. Select the **Attachments** button (paper clip symbol) in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Open** to open the file. Review the amounts in the Excel document.

## <a name="run-vat-declaration"></a>Run a VAT declaration for multiple legal entities

To use the formats to report the VAT declaration for a group of legal entities, you must first set up the application-specific parameters of the ER formats for sales tax codes from all required legal entities.

### Set up electronic messages to collect tax data from several legal entities

Follow these steps to set up electronic messages to collect data from multiple legal entities.

1. Go to **Workspaces** > **Feature management**.
2. Find and select the **Cross-company queries for the populate records actions** feature in the list, and then select **Enable now**.
3. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Electronic messages** > **Populate records actions**.
4. On the **Populate records action** page, select the line for **DK Populate VAT return records**.

   In the **Datasources setup** grid, a new **Company** field is available. For existing records, this field shows the identifier of the current legal entity.

5. In the **Datasources setup** grid, add a line for each additional legal entity that must be included in reporting. For each new line, set the following fields.

    | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
    |------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Name                   | Enter a value that will help you understand where this record comes from. For example, enter **VAT payment of Subsidiary 1**. |
    | Message item type      | Select **VAT return**. This value is the only value that is available for all the records.                                    |
    | Account type           | Select **All**.                                                                                                               |
    | Master table name      | Specify **TaxReportVoucher** for all the records.                                                                             |
    | Document number field  | Specify **Voucher** for all the records.                                                                                      |
    | Document date field    | Specify **TransDate** for all the records.                                                                                    |
    | Document account field | Specify **TaxPeriod** for all the records.                                                                                    |
    | Company                | Select the ID of the legal entity.                                                                                            |
    | User query             | This checkbox is automatically selected when you define criteria by selecting **Edit query**.                                 |

6. For each new line, select **Edit query**, and specify a related settlement period for the legal entity that is specified in the **Company** field on the line.

When the setup is completed, the **Collect data** function on the **Electronic messages** page collects sales tax payments from all legal entities that you defined.
